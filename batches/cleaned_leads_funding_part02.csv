Today, Baja Construction is considered a pioneer in the carport and RV & Boat Storage industry.

At present, business owners will tell you that electrical cost is one of the largest line items in operating a business! If you can reduce this expenditure you can reduce your bottom line! Why not install solar carports either on existing parking area(s) or new sites and use the solar support systems vertical space as a second income resource! It's a win, win for everyone. 

All Baja Construction, solar and standard, and shade canopies are custom-designed and tailored to meet our customers' budgetary needs to achieve their structural objectives. Materials include cold-rolled light-gauge, high tensile-steel framing and components, and roof deck panels. All structure materials per ASTM standards and in strict compliance with AISI S100.

It is open source, secure, and provides centralized control over distributed code repositories. Developers get code review tools and custom APIs that work across Mercurial, Git & SVN. Companies get unified security and access controls so that their CTOs can sleep at night.

Unlike aged source code management solutions or Git-only tools, RhodeCode provides a modern platform, with unified security and tools for any version control system. The platform has been built for highly secure, behind-the-firewall enterprise environments with sophisticated user management and common authentication. Yet, it is very developer-oriented: open source, with tool integrations and powerful APIs.

*Company History*
A few years ago, a large European telecom company was undergoing a change. One of the software developers, Marcin Kuzminski, was tasked with migrating the company's code repositories from a centralized version control system to a distributed one. It quickly became evident to him that there are no tools for common authentication and security across the whole code base. Marcin started hacking instruments, and that was the beginning of RhodeCode.

Fast forward to 2016. RhodeCode is an open source platform that helps manage code of the most secure, behind-the-firewall repositories in a unified way (Mercurial, Git, and Subversion). Some of the world's largest corporate and security firms use RhodeCode.

It's not just a motto. It's Antidote's purpose, our business model – and our ethos.

Why? In the U.S. alone, more than 82 million people don't have adequate health insurance.

That is an injustice. It is bad for the economy. And it is morally indefensible.
We strive to attain a world in which every human being has access to affordable quality healthcare, no matter their race, location, or circumstance. Access to affordable healthcare means more than being able to see a doctor when you're sick. It means being able to live your life fully, without unnecessary barriers and fear. In fact, we steadfastly believe that quality everyday healthcare is a basic human right.

This world we're trying to achieve is one in which we all look out for each other, and no one gets left behind.

That is why we created Antidote Health. Our services are designed for everyone, regardless of their current health status or financial resources, and are based on a simple premise: the cost of healthcare can be reduced by making people healthier and keeping them that way.

We are revolutionizing the way healthcare is paid for and delivered, putting most of the services patients need under one roof, making them affordable and simplifying the entire process. We take care of our patients' health and quality of life, inspired by the most fundamental element of society: the community.

No community is truly healthy if one of its members is sick. And whenever one of its members flourishes, the entire community does. We're all in this together.

And we all deserve good healthcare. All of us. Everyone. We're working to create a better world, in which no one is left behind.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/avihaisoudri

Designed to meet the increasing demand for efficacy and productivity in the areas of drug discovery and life sciences research, we provide automated, real-time, high-content and highly sensitive detection systems that are as predictive and cost effective as they are revolutionary. 

Most current in vitro drug testing methods use two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures that do not take into account the impact of the physical environment in which cells grow. This results in unsatisfactory, sometimes misleading and non-predictive data for in vivo responses.  The ready-to-use tissues and assay platforms produced by InvivoSciences provide three-dimensional (3D) geometrics and physical environments for cells, bridging the gap between cell-based systems and isolated organ tissue systems or animal models, and can therefore act as model systems for chemical screening assays. This provides researchers with screening strategies that can assess the potential toxicity of new drugs--including those for cardiac applications--in accurate, predictive detection environments requiring less time and cost than corresponding studies using animals. 
 
On Mar 24-25, 2009, InvivoSciences presented its technology and business model at the World's Best Technology showcase in Texas. InvivoSciences was among the top 3 award winners at the showcase.

Our core technology enables discovery of therapeutic targets and leads, while reducing the time and money required for efficacy screening. It efficiently turns human stem cells into fat cells and accelerates their growth to sizes that are thousands of times larger than conventional limits and that match the sizes of mature fat cells in adults. Changes in fat cell size are how adults gain (or lose) weight, and increased fat cell size predicts diabetes better than obesity per se. The products we develop will treat obesity and diabetes by shrinking fat cell size and by preventing compromised metabolism in enlarged cells. We differentiate ourselves from existing therapies (e.g. GLP-1 analogs, SGLT2 inhibitors, anorexiants, intestinal lipase inhibitors, insulin secretagogues) by focusing on adipocyte-intrinsic mechanisms of action enabled by our core technology.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-pope-a8a35b6
