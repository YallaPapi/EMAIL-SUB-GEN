Leveraging more than 400 publications in clinical research and development, MSI's proprietary technology, MyoStrain¬Æ, is a 10-minute, non-invasive heart function test providing physicians with sensitive diagnostic markers to support the early assessment and individualized treatment of heart dysfunction. 

This novel cardiac tool leverages the power of high-speed MR imaging to help physicians detect and measure the effects of cardiotoxicity during cancer treatments. Physicians are using MyoStrain as a critical solution to holistically evaluate and protect patient heart health without interfering with oncology care. 

Today, with mounting evidence that many oncology treatments cause cardiotoxicity, new cancer patients and survivors are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, diagnostics often cannot detect cardiotoxicity until symptoms occur, which is usually a sign of cardiac damage. 

The MyoStrain test works by quantifying segmental strain across 48 segments of the heart. This safe and rapid test produces a comprehensive report and MyoHealth‚Ñ¢ Score, a single number that helps indicate patient heart health and enables physicians to manage cardio-protection over time.

MyoStrain has received FDA-510(k) pre-market clearance, CE-mark certification, and is commercially available in the United States and Europe.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/clete-madden-b0857b10

""You don't know what better is until you actually experience it,"" he recalls, and was then determined to offer back-to-basics eating all across America.

Chef and restaurateur Brian Bennett shared Paul's vision. Over dinner one evening, both men celebrated the flavor of clean, ""real food"" ingredients, but lamented how most Americans don't know where their food comes from and have difficulty accessing higher-quality ingredients.

Thus began their quest to change America's food story.

Paul and Brian knew this story must start at the source. They traveled to and partnered with renowned vineyards for exclusive wines, California cattle ranchers for humanely raised beef, and calamari fishermen in Rhode Island for sustainably harvested seafood. Their Never-Settle Sourcing philosophy meant collaborating with the most conscientious and talented farmers and purveyors they could find. And just like that, a new restaurant concept was born.

Paul Martin's American Grill is on a mission to make the food America loves set to a higher standard‚Äîalways without hormones or antibiotics‚Äîand all served in an environment of convivial and remarkable hospitality.

rPlanet Earth was born out of a shared concern over the state of the single-use plastics industry in North America and a passion to create a better solution. Our vision is clear: zero plastic waste on our planet earth. To achieve this, we have created a first-of-its-kind vertically integrated recycling-to-packaging plant. Our unique 300,000-sq.-ft. facility handles bales of post-consumer PET plastics, ensuring drink bottles and thermoformed cups, trays, and containers are recycled properly and transformed back into premium packaging for our customers.

(BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by giving brands the power to use this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.

Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has led to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.

We are a venture-backed well-funded company and work with some of the world's largest brands, retailers, and clothing manufacturers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Our office is located in San Francisco, CA.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/dainaburnes

Founded in 2008, TCHO Chocolate crafts award-winning and imaginative chocolate by collaborating directly with cocoa farmers at flavor labs across the world to grow better, more consistent cacao beans to create authentic craft chocolate to inspire the world's chefs, hobby bakers, and chocolate enthusiasts. Like wine or coffee, cacao's inherent flavors vary based on the terroir where it is grown, as well as on key processes, like fermentation or roasting, that influence the development of flavor. Since not all cacao is created equal, TCHO established TCHO Source, a one-of-a-kind sourcing and educational partnership with farmers, co-operatives, and agronomists all over the world. By installing TCHO Flavor Labs in key cacao-producing locations, creating industry cacao sensory analysis standards, conducting sensory training, developing standardized fermentation and drying processes, improving infrastructure, and sharing information throughout the world of cacao, TCHO has turned its suppliers into co-creators. From there, TCHO hand-selects every ingredient used to craft its award-winning chocolates for a great experience from first glance to last bite.

As a certified B Corporation, we lean on our founding value of curiosity to find new ways to use our business to better the world through chocolate.

Last year, CMOM served more than 350,000 people, which included 65,000 children who visited the Museum as part of a school group or through one of the Museum's off-site partners. CMOM is committed to making its exhibits and programs available to all, and with nearly 50 sites around New York City, we continually reach thousands of families who might not otherwise be able to benefit from our services.

CMOM's four priority areas are meant to impact children in ways that will last a lifetime: early childhood education prepares children to enter kindergarten; creativity in the arts and sciences inspires creative and analytical thinking skills for lifelong learning; healthy lifestyles programs provide a blueprint for a family's physical, emotional and environmental well being; and the exploration of world cultures gives children awareness, understanding and context for the diverse society they are part of. These priorities are met through exhibitions, classes, workshops, performances and Museum-sponsored festivals.

CMOM's programs and exhibits are designed to address the multiple ways children learn and to help parents understand and support their children's development. This approach is reflected in all the Museum's exhibits, including the celebrated PlayWorks‚Ñ¢ floor for pre-schoolers, Gods, Myths and Mortals: Discover Ancient Greece designed as an introduction to art, science and literature; and the Healthy Living programming produced with healthcare providers to encourage good nutrition and daily exercise. Professional Development training is offered to early childhood and school educators as a means to broaden CMOM's influence in reaching children and their families effectively.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/dava-schub-a1a8646

Founded in 2017 by Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, the company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, with additional offices in Munich, Stuttgart, Gothenburg, Tokyo, and Pangyo.

Our software products are based on proven open-source software, such as ROS or Eclipse iceoryx. We fork software that has been developed and proven in use by large developer communities. We then add what is missing: Functional safety, flawless performance, and support for application in commercial and safety-critical products. In order to do so, we have developed a proprietary process to rework open-source software in record time such that it conforms to the highest requirements of the applicable functional safety standard. 

Distinguished by our experienced and agile team, we bring in the right pedigree: Expertise in modern software engineering to build software that scales, leading know-how in software functional safety, experience bringing software to market, and twenty-plus years of experience building autonomous systems. 

We launched our award-winning first product Apex.Grace, formerly known as Apex.OS in 2020 and have taken it through certification in record time for launch in 2021. We enable software-defined vehicles. Learn more about us at www.apex.ai",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/dejanpan

OUR ROOTS
We were born from the compassionate vision and dream of Senator James Couzens. Following the great stock market crash of 1929, record numbers of children were abandoned, suffering hopelessly with a seemingly bleak future.

James Couzens chose not to look away, but to look deeper. He inspired other leaders to do the same. Those who saw children not as they were, but for what they could become.

Almost a century later, James Couzens' vision has become a movement shared by many who are joined in a common resolve. A resolve to make life work for children, so they may grow into the amazing people they were born to be, regardless of their circumstances, mental health, or behavioral challenges.

Here's to the possibility that life can not only work for children ‚Äî but that children can dream again.

BRAND PROMISE
Helping children dream again.

MISSION
We put children and families at the center of all we do. We strive to help them shape their own futures, and carve out a path that's brighter than even they imagine.

BELIEFS
‚Ä¢ We believe in treating and healing the whole child and family.
‚Ä¢ We believe in advancing care through the use of evidence-based treatments.
‚Ä¢ We believe in respecting our children's struggles and advocating for their rights.
‚Ä¢ And most of all, we believe in building bigger dreams and brighter futures.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/desiree-jennings-28951a1b

Time consuming, manual stroke detection means a majority of in-hospital strokes aren't detected or treated for over 4.5 hours resulting in poor outcomes, increased cost and liability, and even patient death.
Neuralert automates stroke detection using non-invasive wristbands that continuously monitor patient arm asymmetry, a classic indication of stroke. The bands transmit telemetry to a patented algorithm, developed by the University of Pennsylvania, which analyzes the data for stroke symptoms. The algorithm also eliminates asymmetry caused by other factors (e.g., hand dominance, eating, an IV in the arm) resulting in an extremely low false alarm rate. When stroke asymmetry is detected, the system immediately alerts staff so they can assess the patient and speed treatment. 
The automated Neuralert stroke monitoring system has been proven to detect stroke symptoms five times faster than the current standard of care. Faster stroke detection will save lives, improve outcomes, reduce cost and litigation, and ensure patients are not forced to face a potential lifetime of disability and loss of independence.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/detansinn

ThirdAI (pronunciation:  /TH…ôrd ƒ´/ Third eye) is a cutting-edge Artificial intelligence startup carving scalable and sustainable AI. 

UNIQUE APPROACH- ThirdAI accelerator builds hash-based processing algorithms for training and inference with neural networks. The technology is a result of 10 years of innovation in finding efficient (beyond tensor) mathematics for deep learning.  

Our algorithmic innovation has demonstrated how we can make Commodity x86 CPUs 15x or faster than most potent NVIDIA GPUs for training large neural networks.

The demonstration has shaken the common knowledge prevailing in the AI community that specialized processors like GPUs are significantly superior to CPUs for training neural networks.

Several media outlets echo our technological superiority: 

IEEE Spectrum describes, ""What they report is stunning."" Investorplace considers the algorithm one of the biggest threats to NVIDIA Stock (a $500  billion company). 

Engadget calls it a ""Completely different approach to Deep Learning"". 

A quote from WCCFTech says, ""If an implementation of this algorithm is mainstreamed it would almost instantly disrupt the dynamics of the deep learning ecosystem. Valuations of companies could change overnight.""

Our innovation would not only benefit current AI training by shifting to lower-cost CPUs, but it should also allow the ""unlocking"" of AI training workloads on GPUs that were not previously feasible.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanrajp
