The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to ""carpet bomb"" patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

PAD is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the legs or lower extremities; it is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis. PAD can happen in any blood vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms. It affects 200 million people globally. Approximately 6.5 million people at the age of 40 and older in the United States have PAD. These numbers continue to rise given the increasing burden of risk factors and an aging population. If a patient has PAD, they are at risk for developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke as well.
The R3 Vascular BVS platform combines the best of both worlds of BTK therapy, designed to deliver the ‚Äòstent-like' support of a scaffold, along with the anti-inflammatory result of sirolimus, but ‚Äòdisappearing' over time as the vessel heals.
