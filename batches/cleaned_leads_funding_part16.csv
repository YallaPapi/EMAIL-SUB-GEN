Stimulating these macrophages produces a rapid therapeutic response throughout the body as we have seen in our strong preclinical data. This is unlike any existing immunotherapies today - immunotherapies which in total have annual sales of $70B. Because the antimicrobial action of our compounds is through the activation of phagocytosis, the development of multidrug resistance is not anticipated.

Our goal is to save and improve lives, reduce hospital costs, & provide an effective treatment to diseases like BPD, VAP, and ARDS with no adverse side effects that are seen with the current alternatives. 

Our lead candidate is Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designated by the US FDA for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in at-risk preterm infants. BPD is a rare pediatric lung disease in preterm babies caused by inflammation from supplemental oxygen required for survival in the NICU and is the second leading cause of death in preterm babies.

We believe standalone AI technologies cannot emulate true human intelligence that consists of deep knowledge and proactive interactions, nor create platforms that can interact with humans over long periods of time to help us reach conscious objectives. A new approach to building truly intelligent systems needs to be grounded in both biology and technology. It needs to be compounded by commercialization, and it needs to be tied to a spiritual vision that goes beyond a single self. 

Atman's unique research lies at the novel intersection of custom Reinforcement Learning environments, large-scale Knowledge Representation, and multi-modal Generative Models, which mimic how humans dynamically strategize and interact with the world, reason, and communicate. We are deploying our platform in products across a number of commercial domains to demonstrate the value of our approach – starting with building proactive shopping concierges for e-commerce, to eventually launching products that scale expert-led interactions across travel, healthcare, education, and more. By building machines that emulate human experts and act symbiotically with humans, we want to allow humans to experience a higher level of consciousness in their lives and develop a deeper intuition of consciousness as a whole.

H2Pro's E-TAC electrolyzer is a revolutionary system for producing green hydrogen by splitting water at 95% energy efficiency (compared to 60-70% efficiency of conventional systems).  This breakthrough efficiency combined with E-TAC's reduced cost of materials, easily scalable membraneless design, and high compatibility with renewables will allow H2Pro systems to deliver the lowest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH).

In order to reach net zero, green hydrogen must be integrated into hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel, ammonia, refineries, heavy transport and aviation. It will also serve a critical role in energy storage and as a green molecule for renewable energy export. H2Pro is committed to accelerating the widespread adoption of this vital decarbonization tool by making it economically viable by the end of this decade. 

Headquartered in Caesarea, Israel, H2Pro was founded in 2019 based on years of research conducted at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. H2Pro has raised over 100 Million USD. It is backed by leading investors and strategic partners, including Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Temasek Holdings, Horizons Ventures, ArcelorMittal, Yara Growth Ventures, OurCrowd, COPEC, Hyundai, Sumitomo Corporation, Extantia, Bazan, Doral and New Fortress Energy.

Teague,Founder & CEO,teague@energyx.com,United States,renewables & environment,400000000.0,EnergyX,Teague Egan,2018.0,,"EnergyX is a sustainable energy company focused on direct lithium extraction, refinery and battery technology.  Combining these technologies from brine to battery will create a process dramatically lowering the cost of lithium resources.  The company's goal is to develop technology and assets that turn it into one of the premier, low-cost lithium providers for the growing lithium-ion battery industry.

The electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage revolution is generating high demand for lithium, with some analysts forecasting orders-of-magnitude demand increases.  As the EV market rapidly expands, millions of large-scale battery packs will be in demand.  The estimated annual production of EV's is 20,000,000 per year.   For one 85-kWh car, the price of the lithium in the battery is approximately $2,945 per car.  Residential (home) and commercial batteries are also gaining market demand traction, and California has implemented law stating by 2020 all new homes will require solar arrays.  

Companies already producing lithium are attempting to increase production as battery cell manufacturers are scaling up lithium-ion production with mega factories and actively acquiring raw materials through long term off-take supply agreements.  In the Lithium Triangle, where 50-70% of the world's known lithium reserve is located, current methods of extraction are based off outdated, natural evaporation pond technology, which takes 18 months, and loses 50-70% of the lithium due to co-precipitation. 

Our solution is to optimize and apply a highly scalable lithium extraction membrane to the process.  The ability to efficiently extract and aggregate the lithium elements from the salt brines using proprietary, multi-level, synthetic ion separation techniques can increase time efficiency by 100x and recovery rate by 300%.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/teagueegan

·       Entrepreneurship and STEAM Education

·       Infrastructure and Transportation

·       Quality of Life

Cincinnati Works will partner with all willing and capable people living in poverty to assist them in advancing to economic self-sufficiency through employment.

Our Vision:
We will lead the effort to eliminate poverty in our community.


Cincinnati Works serves two clients: those individuals in the community who are currently unemployed or underemployed and Employers who have entry level positions. The short-term goal for the unemployed is to help them stabilize in a job that pays a living wage with health benefits.

The long-term goal for the underemployed is for them to earn 200% of the federal poverty rate and move to economic self-sufficiency. Economically self-sufficient people become taxpayers and productive citizens who no longer require public assistance.

As a primarily privately-funded organization, we are able to serve any willing and capable job seekers who are eligible for our program. We are able to serve those who would otherwise be ineligible for other programs (e.g. men, women without dependent children and women without children).

Our clients become Members of the Cincinnati Works program and receive lifetime Membership for as long as they are employed or actively seeking work.
