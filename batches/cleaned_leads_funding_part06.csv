At Sinclair Digital, we're redefining the landscape of intelligent building technology, focusing on enhancing your building experience through innovative, sustainable solutions.

DC power and Power over Ethernet form the essential backbone for constructing sustainable intelligent buildings.

Benefit from proven energy savings of at least 10% with our DC microgrid solution, validated by the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory whitepaper.

There's no more efficient path for a building to achieve net-zero than through our approach.

This is the Tesla moment where we move away from fossil fuels and analog systems to DC microgrids and true two way intelligence for commercial buildings.

Sinclair Digital is breaking down barriers by uniting segregated systems and design teams. Energy management, operational efficiency, health and wellness, and occupant experience, once pursued in isolation, are now seamlessly integrated.

By implementing low voltage DC power with POE, we enable these systems and teams to collaborate seamlessly, achieving the common goal of crafting sustainable smart buildings.

Our mission encompasses not only ushering in the transition to sustainable energy but also enhancing the occupant experience within high-performance buildings.

We specialize in providing design, build, and integration services for sustainable, smart building systems. Additionally, our passion for innovation drives us to create pioneering products and software applications, propelling the industry forward.

Scammers are using the names and photos of our management team to scam individuals who believe they are applying to open roles at Firefly Health.  These scams can be very convincing.  
The fraudsters often request recipients to provide personal information and to make payments as part of their fake recruiting process. They may also offer fraudulent employment opportunities to applicants and often ask for sensitive personal and financial information, including requiring candidates to arrange travel for face-to-face interviews with a certain travel agency. Firefly will never ask an applicant to send us money. We will also never offer an applicant a job without a verbal interview.

Third parties play an instrumental role in today's business environment, and sensitive data is shared amongst companies that are part of their ecosystems. 
Compliance requirements hold organizations liable for any data breaches involving companies that ""touch"" their data, which means steep fines and potential business disruptions. Massive cloud adoption further complicates the scenario because securing the cloud is more difficult than in other environments and skilled personnel is scarce. The current methods and tools used by companies to manage their third-party risk make the process very confrontational, yet shallow and without visibility into cloud environments. Tenchi's product was developed from scratch to be based on cooperation, with a controlled sharing of security postures and maturity data between organizations that is beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Large enterprises can finally have the visibility they need to ensure that their data is properly secured whether it is in their own environments or in a third party's. Third parties gain much-needed help to improve their security postures through an automated process that greatly reduces the burdens they face dealing with endless questionnaires and audits. Plus, the product reduces information asymmetry in the ecosystem, so market forces can work to reward security-conscious third parties with more business from regulated corporate customers and higher margins.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-boucas-77754b2

The ability to directly measure the combustion process enables the process to be optimized. For coal-fired power plants this means improved efficiency, increased reliability, and reduced emissions of NOx and CO2, the leading cause of climate change. The United States consumes more than 1,000,000,000 tons of coal every year, thus even small efficiency improvements can have a significant impact. For instance, improving the efficiency of the US coal-fired fleet by an average of just 2%, a goal attainable using Zolo Technologies' sensor technology, is equivalent to:

Reducing CO2 emissions by 43,000,000 tons
Removing 8,000,000 cars from the roads
Creating 5,000,000 CO2-free households
Installing 30,000 large wind turbines

Parking Sucks - we know. We may not be able to solve it entirely but we can take away a lot of the stress. Everyday, people leave their garages and driveways to go to work, on vacation, or visit a friend. They leave their parking spot barren. Empty. Unused. Then, at night when business wraps up and everyone is enjoying Happy Hour or heads home, their designated work spots sit vacant. With all of the frustrated people scouring the cities for spots, why are there so many empty spaces that no one can use?!

Pied Parker is the solution - keep the streets from being overrun with frustrated, parking-hungry people, and keep empty parking spots from being left lonely and desolate. Pied Parker connects the people anxiously searching for parking with the unused parking spots left by their owners, whether for a few hours, a day or a week. From driveway spots to assigned apartment or office spots, there is bound to be a vacant spot for each parking-craving driver. We just help them find each other. No more having to explain to your boss, friends, or clients why you are running 20 minutes late, and how have coffee conveniently spilled down the front of your shirt. No more friends chuckling at you from their apartment window as you circle the block for the third time. No more nausea from the incessant turns of the parking garage ramps.

Pied Parker takes the hassle out of parking, so you can focus on the things that really matter.
Simplify your commute, your vacation or your day trip
Never guess where you are going to park again",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/giannimaxemin

This longstanding issue has caused inefficiencies, delays, and costly errors, burdening providers and suppliers alike. Beyond being a frustration, it represents a systemic problem with significant financial and operational consequences for the entire healthcare ecosystem.

Recognizing this, Helia set out to develop a solution tailored to the complexity of modern healthcare. The result is the industry's first comprehensive end-to-end healthcare network that seamlessly connects providers, suppliers, and distributors.

Suppliers are seeing significant reductions in days sales outstanding, improved cash flow, and streamlined operational efficiency.

Looking ahead, Helia is committed to delivering even greater value across our network. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, we're making data interactions faster and smarter. We're delivering the industry's fastest end-to-end case-to-invoice transactions—processing in as little as 60 seconds—and we're introducing advanced case scheduling features that enable providers and suppliers across our network to make real-time, data-driven decisions.
