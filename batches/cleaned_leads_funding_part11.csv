The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its ""Pittsburgh Live!"" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in back-to-back Grammy Award nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony radio broadcasts aired nationally and in the late 1970s it made the ground breaking PBS series ""Previn and the Pittsburgh."" Since 1982, the orchestra has been heard through national network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by Classical WQED-FM, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.  At home in historic Heinz Hall, the Pittsburgh Symphony offers a variety of musical experiences, including its BNY Mellon Grand Classics and PNC Pops series, FUSE@PSO series, Fiddlesticks Family Concerts series, specials, and numerous community engagement and education concerts throughout the region.

The system also tracks the surgeon's instruments and provides ""light-ray"" guidance so that the surgeon can plan and see the trajectory of their tools in relation to the patient's anatomy throughout the procedure.

MediView's platform technologies also utilize remote connectivity to permit medical professionals to collaborate for patient care with shared communication, visualization and holographic guidance.

• Multi-standard collaborative pencil & paper challenges
• Integrated whole class activities
• Data-driven intervention support for struggling students

All Empowerment starts when you take control of your decisions.  Helping you make better decisions is our mission.

Spotivity is a multi-faceted platform tackling the teen boredom pandemic while creating business solutions to the wonderful programs that cater to teens. We aim to help teens find meaningful activities, their parents to feel good about those activities, and those program directors to feel supported. Spotivity removes key logistical barriers to entry and provides a dynamic engagement platform for all. Leveraging the latest mobile technology, spotivity has created the first of its kind platform with mapping capabilities and personality insight quizzes to create a fully immersive and custom experience for the teens, helping them discover new passions.

Each year, over 40 million American children and teenagers occupy non-school hours, but only half of that number are engaged with after school activity. After school hours represent a potential landmine of positive and negative developmental opportunities for youth. Regardless of socioeconomic backgrounds, in-school time can, at most, provide positive youth engagement for only 20% of the youth's time per week. Spotivity helps fill-in unused time voids and supports the unlocking of potential through meaningful matching of interest, access, and resources (currently spotivity lists 10 discrete categories of activities – Sports, Education, Mentoring, Health, The Arts, Volunteering, Jobs, Internships, Summer Camps, and Virtual).",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/montanabutsch

the website www.naturallclub.com. Select their hair treatment area of choice (dry hair, dull hair, damaged hair). Select the duration of their treatment (1 month to one year). Then, each month they receive a NaturAll Club box customized to meet their hair needs - complete with everything for a spa-night at home. It's that easy! 

Organic products are the fastest growing type of products in the beauty and cosmetics industry. But even with the increasing natural options, hair care products are still limited. Due to the short shelf life, many conventional hair products avoid using fresh ingredients such as avocados, bananas and coconut crème found to help hair become healthier when used regularly.  Therefore the only way to really get fresh hair products is to do-it-yourself at home.
 
But while many are enticed, the vast majority are easily discouraged by the time needed to research, buy, & mix the right ingredients. NaturAll Club is the solution to these deterrents.

By using a subscription model we can ship products within one week after they are made, delivering the freshest ingredients in hair care. Our product development is led by a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering allowing us to provide customization to hair care needs.

The founders recognized the opportunity to combine environmental domain expertise with intelligent and patient capital to benefit from regulatory driven compensatory spend. 

ESP's strategy is to purchase land or interests in land that can generate significant restoration yields following successful entitlement and ecological restoration and/or enhancement combined with long-term conservation of the properties. The successful execution of ESP's strategy provides a long-lasting positive impact to the environment.

ESP seeks to invest in locations that have strong existing or expected mitigation demand from a diversified customer base (often a mix of industrial, commercial and public infrastructure demand) or a fully committed, concentrated source of demand (e.g. a large mining project under a long-term mitigation supply contract). As a leading provider of investment capital for large-scale mitigation projects, ESP has unique access to mitigation markets that have not traditionally used third-party mitigation solutions including those dominated by large-scale extractive (mining, oil & gas, etc.) and public infrastructure (levees, dams, pipelines, highways, etc.) development.

We also seek to partner with related service providers or land owners that have an interest in establishing wetland or stream restoration opportunities as well as potential customers that have a need for an experienced wetlands or stream restoration service provider.

Supported by $250 million of committed equity, ESP is one of the best capitalized operators in the environmental services market.

Part of the federal government's Manufacturing USA network, REMADE is dedicated to accelerating the U.S.'s transition to a Circular Economy.

Investments in renewables are critical, but they can only get us a little more than halfway - 55% - toward our nation's net-zero by 2050 goal. A Circular Economy approach to how we make and use things - how we manufacture and use everyday products - will make up the remaining 45%, getting us all the way to net-zero. 

REMADE is committed to meeting the nation's climate and industrial decarbonization goals by addressing manufacturing's impact on climate change. Today, manufacturing accounts for 25% of U.S. energy consumption at a cost of $150 billion. Industry is also the third-largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at 22%. 

Together with our partners, REMADE invests in early-stage R&D projects that reduce energy consumption, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, conserve resources, increase the supply and use of recycled materials, enhance the resiliency of the nation's supply chain, increase U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, and create clean economy jobs. 

The technologies that REMADE develops increase the reuse, remanufacturing, recovery and recycling of four ""hard-to-abate"" materials: metals, plastics/polymers, fibers/paper, and e-waste. These technologies, once fully deployed, are capable of :
- saving 1 quad of energy, the equivalent of conserving 180 million barrels of oil
- reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 MMT per year, the equivalent of eliminating the annual emissions of 11.5 million cars
- generating billions of dollars in new opportunities, supporting U.S. economic growth
- creating and retaining hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the U.S.

Ransomware attacks are evolving, bypassing even the most advanced prevention tools and perimeter security systems. Current solutions focus on monitoring server activity, not the integrity of your data, which is precisely what ransomware targets. Your data  may be infected with ransomware without you, or your security solution, knowing till it's too late. 

These attacks often remain undetected for months, slowly infecting your data, which results in your backups being rendered useless when you need them most to recover during an attack. Without understanding your data's integrity, you risk losing everything, even if you think you're protected. 

Elastio's Ransomware Recovery Assurance platform is uniquely engineered to address this critical gap. By deeply understanding how ransomware encrypts data and leveraging its AI/ML data integrity technologies, Elastio finds the hidden ransomware that other solutions can't detect– ensuring early alerting and identification of issues and enabling safe recoveries of your critical data post-attack.

Elastio will not only alert you when it discovers a potential problem, but Elastio will identify the last known clean recovery point before the attack, eliminating what could be a lengthy and costly process after an outage.

The symbols act as signposts showing students how to accurately sound out words. After completing the five-week course, the symbols are removed, like training wheels from a bicycle, and students are reading on their own.

The founder of our program learned to read Japanese in one week when she lived in Japan by learning Hiragana. She has since adapted this system for English.

For hunters who are looking for new opportunities on private land, LandTrust is a website where they can connect directly with landowners and book hunts. Unlike expensive annual leases, guided hunts, or door knocking, LandTrust makes accessing private land simple.

For farmers and ranchers who are looking for a practical way to add income to their operations, LandTrust is a website that connects landowners with respectful sportsmen looking to pay for access to their land. Unlike government programs, leases, or outfitters, LandTrust is a partner that helps build a valuable new income from sportsmen while keeping landowners in full control.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicdecastro
