Industrial companies deploy a range of sensors, controllers and technology at the ""edge"" to achieve their
business goals, but often they have no way to unify legacy and modern systems or integrate different legacy protocols to implement systems at scale. Building custom systems for IoT is the dominant marketplace solution, but it is cost prohibitive and time consuming. Further technology obsolescence is a big barrier to large scale implementation of long-lived systems.

Our products, the Machfu platform and the Machfu gateway, bring edge to enterprise connectivity to existing industrial infrastructure that can be deployed and scaled quickly. Rapid and highly secure application development means increased productivity and efficiency as well as improved operations. Using our Machfu gateways, our customers can easily build applications that integrate their existing technology and equipment with the cloud.

Businesses want to take advantage of the flexibility, scalability, and speed of the cloud. However, lack of proactive and automated processes for cloud management can lead to challenges such as increased costs, higher residual risk, and the impediment of DevOps. By delivering consistent security and compliance across cloud environments, Cloud Raxak enables businesses to undergo successful cloud transformations while reducing the risk, time, and costs involved.

Some key issues of cloud security are:
-- Security compliance is up to 40% of the cost of managing cloud applications
-- Manual or semi-automated security management is slow, error prone, and insecure
-- 50% of public cloud VM security parameters are configured incorrectly at boot
-- 95% of public cloud VM security parameters can be configured automatically, significantly reducing the time, costs, and human error involved

Raxak Protect is a SaaS-based security offering that empowers IT and application development teams, by simplifying and automating security and compliance across private and public clouds. Key features of the platform include:
-- Leading edge security profiles based on government and industry standards (CIS, DISA & NIST STIGs, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FFIEC, FISMA, etc.)

The analogy we use is that data vendors are selling car parts. Imagine walking into a Honda dealership, and instead of selling you a Civic, they sold you an engine, and you had to build your own car.

It turns out that SMBs  don't care about buying and integrating multiple vendors. They want a complete platform (car) that works out of the box. That's exactly what we have created at 5X.

Companies use 5X for 3 reasons:

 1) Build a data platform from scratch, or fill in missing pieces on your existing platform.

2) Decrease the total cost of ownership by up to 50%.

3) Use our full stack data consultancy for support on data strategy, analytics, data engineering, cost optimization or AI/ML.

5X was founded in 2020 with presence in the USA, Singapore, UK and India. Our global team is 70+ people strong and rapidly growing.

ISNO inventory occurs when products are available in-store and often in the warehouse but not online, resulting in lost sales from customers who cannot find the product they want on a retailer's website. 

Retailers are struggling to accurately manage their ISNO inventory and keep it up-to-date with changes in their physical stores.ISNO arises from an over-reliance on manual processes and spreadsheets to manage the creation of the required digital assets and data. The disconnected processes and systems retailers use fail to provide the visibility and operational efficiency required to quickly launch products. Enter Sweft, the ultimate solution to ISNO. Sweft is a SaaS workflow productivity tool designed to help retailers launch products more efficiently, resulting in optimized full-price sales. Sweft was created by an experienced team of former e-commerce retailers with a deep understanding of the ISNO problem. With Sweft, retailers sell more products at full price, improving profitability.

An end-to-end solution, Sweft increases revenues and profitability by enhancing collaboration & communication across the company, and by improving productivity through reduction of data entry and tedious tasks.

Today we have a growing user base, who are happy to have found a method of birth control that is right for them and that allows them to get to know their bodies and cycles. No matter what your choice is, we believe that every woman should know that understanding how your cycle works matters. 

Natural Cycles was created when our founders, Elina and Raoul, were in search of an effective method of natural birth control. Their journey took them from physics straight into health tech for women. The couple were unsatisfied with what they found, so they decided to apply their experience and knowledge in advanced mathematics and data analysis to develop a solution to meet their needs. This turned out to be an algorithm that detects and predicts ovulation and fertility.

In the early days, they used the algorithm for their own purposes but quickly realized that there was a vast unmet need for this type of method. They decided to develop a mobile app so women from all over the world could easily access and use Natural Cycles.

Our company has been up and running since 2013 and has been rapidly growing since our CE certification in February 2017. At Natural Cycles we are always looking for passionate talents to help us strive for change in such a complex, scientific, and controversial field.

The beautyblender concept came to Rea Ann while she was the Department Head of one of the first TV shows shot in hi-definition. Rea Ann handled the constant touch-ups with her hand-cut, edgeless sponges to mimic the seamless look of airbrushing. Soon, every celebrity that sat in Rea Ann's chair wanted their own hand-cut sponge; thus creating the original edgeless sponge. Beautyblender quickly became the secret on set that had every pro talking.
 
Today, the category-creator holds countless beauty awards and is beloved by both makeup aficionados and newbies as the go-to tool for achieving a perfectly blended complexion.
