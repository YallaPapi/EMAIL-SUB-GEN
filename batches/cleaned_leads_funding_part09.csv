We have developed a first-of-its-kind low light energy harvesting photovoltaic (PV) technology that generates more than three times the power of conventional indoor PV technologies from a broader spectrum of indoor and outdoor ambient light. This chemistry breakthrough enables revolutionary advances in device design, function, performance, sustainability, reliability and consumer experience. 

Unlike high performance solar photovoltaic technologies of the past, these innovations are cost compatible with today's mass scale technologies. Ambient employs a novel industrial solar printing technology to coat its proprietary chemistry on thin, durable glass substrates -- producing photovoltaic cells of virtually any size and shape. This flexibility empowers industrial designers, allowing them to embed Ambient's cells into a variety of product shapes and structures.

Ambient enhances manufacturers' opportunities to align with consumer values that further boost sales and brand loyalty. In an era in which consumers value both cutting-edge connected technology and planet-friendly products, Ambient empowers brands to deliver both. By eliminating battery waste and harvesting energy from everyday light, Ambient's PV cells reduce the carbon footprint of average IoT devices by an estimated 77 percent. The company's ambient light-harvested power source also solves the ubiquitous customer pain point of battery life, delivering a maintenance-hassle-free and reliable ownership experience.

Ambient is inspiring a new era in connected device form and function -- delivering superior energy density and performance through a solar cell that advances industrial design and production at scale at a price point that makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kethinni-chittibabu-1489567

Today, Nevco scoreboards, message centers and video displays are used to enhance the fan experience at events worldwide.

The Company derived its name from its founder, Ralph Nevinger. Nevco is known to be the largest privately held scoreboard manufacturer in the world. The Company is headed by G. D. Moore.

The first scoreboard model, manufactured in 1934, consisted of a white oak cabinet with a glass dial clock and glass disks for the scores. Since that time, Nevco has been a leader in the transformation of the scoring and display industry.

Scoreboard technology has advanced from the use of electric motors to solid state electronics; from incandescent bulb models to LED technology; and from hard wired control systems to the use of wireless controls.

The introduction of LED message centers and video displays has provided our Customers additional ways to involve and excite the fans and generate significant sponsorship revenue.

With a commitment to quality, customer service and product innovation, the goal of the Nevco Team is to exceed the needs of our Customers. Our worldwide sales force stands ready to provide a customized solution for your facility.

Now more than ever, businesses need to think about digital transformation and automation. 

Solvoyo is the true enabler of digital transformation. Our cloud based SaaS platform uses advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to optimize and automate decision making in supply chain planning. 

Our all-in-one platform forecasts demand, optimizes inventory, plans production, replenishes networks and concurrently optimizes fulfillment and transportation plans; eliminating silos while reducing the dependency on manual work.

The District Alliance for Safe Housing (DASH) is an innovator in providing access to safe housing and services for survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their families as they rebuild their lives on their own terms. 

HISTORY:
In 2006, DASH was founded at a time when there were less than 50 beds in the District dedicated specifically for victims of domestic violence. Survivors with multiple barriers including mental health and addiction issues had even fewer options for safe housing. Unlike the various housing programs in the city, the vision for DASH has been to create a culture where safe housing is a right shared by everyone.

Since 2006, DASH has grown to become the city's largest dedicated safe housing provider for survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their children.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/koube-ngaaje-50956023

Vic.ai addresses the most manual and inefficient task in accounting – invoice processing – to improve its speed and scalability, and ultimately enable customers to reinvent their accounts payable operations and improve financial management. 

Accounting tasks have always been managed using legacy systems that are based on predefined, fragile rules and templates. It's mundane, inefficient, and error-prone work. Vic.ai throws the need for rules and templates out the window.

Accounting tasks work autonomously with the Vic.ai platform to minimize the human input and interpretation that legacy, rules-based systems require. Vic.ai's accounts payable solution uses advanced AI, which gets smarter the more invoices it ingests, and autonomous workflows to automatically process error-free invoices, allowing the team to focus on more important matters than manual data entry.

Vic.ai works with finance professionals to give them the tools they need to make everyday operations simpler and more intelligent. From processing invoices to data predictions, the Vic.ai intelligent and autonomous solution gives companies the bandwidth needed to complete higher value tasks often pushed aside in the day-to-day.

By processing more than half a billion invoices with up to 99% accuracy, Vic.ai has helped 10,000+ customers achieve nearly $188 million in cost savings and 6 million hours in time savings.

We are a public-private partnership established to drive the next phase of growth for the region – innovation that will be enabled and delivered by startups.

Why do we do this?

A tech-focused economy is a self-sustaining ecosystem that continuously attracts talent, creates jobs and investment opportunities, which eventually leads to one solution, that leads to the next, and then the next.

Greater Cincinnati is primed for this, as we are the home of hundreds of global corporations who depend on innovation to solve their biggest problems, yet, are often too large to be agile.

This may be unlike our tech-based startups who have talent and agility, but often lack the funding to see their solutions through or, if they do, the ability to reach potential customers.

Not to mention, Cincinnati has several Universities with valuable knowledge and research at their fingertips.

All of these entities are all close, but seldom, if ever, collaborating. And with investors waiting to invest wisely across the country, we have all the makings for a thriving tech-based economy – just waiting for something to help set it into motion.

Kym,Castle Manager,kym@muncaster.co.uk,United States,hospitality,217000.0,Muncaster Castle & Pennington Hotels Group,Kym Armstrong,,Raleigh,"A Family owned and run historic Castle on the western coast of the Lake District, with a group of hotel's and establishments throughout.

Comprising of 3 hotels and a historic Inn we pride ourselves on great food and atmosphere for any occasion.

This family derive their pedigree from Gamel de Pennington, who was a very considerable person, before and at the conquest as appears by several ancient rolls, registers, and records; from whom, the present Sir Joseph Pennington, is derived, in a lineal descent of numerous ancestors of note"" so quotes the author of ""The English Baronetage"" published in 1741.

While there are numerous Gamels in Pennington history so it becomes difficult to know to which the above might refer, if the author of the ""English Baronetage"" is correct then the Penningtons were an important family in Cumberland before the Norman Conquest of 1066.

Tracing the early family tree is difficult as few documents survive from this period, further complicated by reuse of popular family names Benedict and Gamel, together with John, Joseph and William in later generation. Gamel even makes a fairly recent reappearance with the 4th Lord Muncaster, born in 1831.

The Pennington family have recorded evidence of Muncaster being their home since 1208, when the lands were granted to Alan de Penitone although some records suggest that the family were at Muncaster back as far as 1026.

In 1464 Sir John Pennington gave shelter to Henry VI, wandering after the Battle of Hexham. Many years later in 1783, John, Lord Muncaster erected the tower known as Chapels to commemorate the place where the fugitive King was supposed to have been found by the shepherds. The legend tells how Holy King Harry on his departure left his drinking bowl behind in gratitude, saying that as long as it should remain quite whole and unbroken the Penningtons would live and thrive in the place. Today the Venetian glass bowl is still intact and is known as the ‘Luck of Muncaster'.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the family married well and in 1783 when there was a vacancy in the Irish Peerage, the fifth Baronet was created first Baron Muncaster. He was a friend of Pitt and long a Member of Parliament. He carried out extensive works at Muncaster, including planting most of the large hardwood trees, and it was he who started the present library. He was succeeded by his brother, General Lowther Pennington, who in his youth was a hot head. While serving in America he killed a man in a duel called for a ""foolish quarrel about humming a tune"".

Shortly before his death in 1862, his grandson Gamel Augustus, fourth Lord Muncaster, instructed Anthony Salvin the famous architect to renovate the house, giving us the castle largely as we know it today.

In 1917 Gamel's brother, the fifth and last Lord Muncaster, died without children and the estate reverted to his nearest relation on his mother's side, Sir John Ramsden, on condition that his second son changed his name from Ramsden to Pennington. A notable family in their own right, the Ramsdens had played a significant part in the history of Yorkshire, as well as owning other estates. It was Sir John who started planting rhododendron seedlings at Muncaster from his other great garden at Bulstrode, Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire, a Somerset family estate which he inherited through his mother.  Sir John was the great grandfather of the Castle's current owner Iona Frost Pennington.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kym-armstrong-b24a8733a
