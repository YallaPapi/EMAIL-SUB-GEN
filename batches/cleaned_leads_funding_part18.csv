TNEDICCA Road Risk Scores℠ quantify accident risk at the geolocation level for more granular risk assessment. Our mission is to reduce future road accidents using location-based data and predictive analytics. Our data-driven solutions support auto insurers, carmakers, navigation service providers and last-mile delivery companies.

Crash location data offers auto insurers a new way to measure road risk and reduce loss costs. Crash location data can also be used to prevent future road accidents by optimizing routes for safety.

WHY IS CRASH LOCATION IMPORTANT?
Accident hotspots are a powerful predictor of where future accidents will happen.
When it comes to measuring road risk, where a person drives matters a lot. Most road accidents are clustered in a few hotspots where driving is riskier, making crash location a powerful predictor of where future accidents will happen. A higher frequency of accidents in certain locations can often be linked to road design.

AUTO INSURER SOLUTIONS
By harnessing the power of crash location analytics, TNEDICCA offers auto insurers solutions to improve their bottom line with:
•	more precise pricing and territory ratemaking
•	better underwriting and risk selection
•	enhanced risk scoring for insurance telematics and connected car data
•	accident hotspot warnings for policyholder safe-driving apps.

Insurers of all sizes can benefit from a more complete understanding of risk that considers where a vehicle is driven.

ROAD SAFETY SOLUTIONS
TNEDICCA road safety solutions are designed to help businesses improve safety and reduce the financial impact of crashes with our proprietary nationwide database of more than 30 million crashes.

Our road safety solutions include route optimization and accident hotspot warnings for:
•	navigation service providers
•	last-mile delivery companies
•	autonomous vehicles
