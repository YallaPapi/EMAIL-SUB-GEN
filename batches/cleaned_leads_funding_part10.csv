Our Vision:
Style freedom through a life well-lived

The Dia & Co Solution:
Dia & Co is the only retail service dedicated to meeting the plus size community's full range of style needs. We're applying the best of data and technology to serve women who have been ignored for far too long—from developing the shopping experiences she's always wanted, to building community platforms that inspire her, to ensuring she sees herself represented in the world around her.

Our Approach — Representative Retail:
Dia & Co is a company built around a customer, not a business model. Our community leads the way, and we meet their unique needs by creating products and experiences across three comprehensive areas of service:

Commerce:
Curated access to the best-fitting Style and Active apparel (led
by Dia & Co's beloved owned brands), fully equipping her to express herself through style. Customized shopping experiences to remove the stress around fit, for a joyful and fabulous experience.

Community:
Platforms to foster deep connections between members both of offline and online, offering a place for her to be celebrated and to celebrate others through style.

Change:
Campaigns to create lasting change by combating stereotypes and biases. Advocacy to increase representation of our community outside the Dia ecosystem, so she can see herself reflected in style.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-gilbert-37a7466

Higher Achievement is rigorous. From 5th through 8th grade, Higher Achievement scholars spend 650 hours a year learning an advanced curriculum that is aligned to state standards. 

Higher Achievement's year-round program is grounded in research. It combines high expectations with high support — demanding academic work plus mentoring, skill-building, individual student achievement plans, and personal encouragement. Elements of Higher Achievement include:

- Afterschool Academy includes core subjects, such as literature and mathematics, as well as seminars, artistic electives, field trips, and opportunities to engage in community service.

- Summer Academy includes coursework in literature, science, mathematics, social studies, and electives, as well as a three-day trip to a college. Small classes and mentoring sessions encourage intellectual curiosity and teach both basic skills and critical thinking. 

- Higher Achievement culminates with high school placement services, which help scholars advance to top academic high schools. In addition to helping scholars identify schools that fit their needs, Higher Achievement helps them prepare for placement tests, practice interview skills, complete applications, and identify resources for financial assistance.

The Higher Achievement program also includes special academic events, including geography challenges, student readings of their own poetry, Olympics of the Mind, and the Green Apple awards.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/lynsey-wood-jeffries-2157484

Extended reality (XR), is gaining more and more traction from consumers and innovative brands are meeting their customers where they are - immersive environments. As these immersive environments are built piece by piece with 3D models, the demand for 3D content has reached a new high. However, in reality, it's a very laborious, expensive, and time-consuming process - creating one digital asset can take a whole team weeks and thousands of dollars.

That's a huge bottleneck, XR platforms are facing today, significantly slowing down workflows and thus impeding scalability, when it comes to 3D asset creation.

Alpha3D is addressing this exact pain point with their generative AI platform that transforms 2D images or text prompts into 3D assets at scale, 10x cheaper and 100x faster than traditional 3D modeling methods.

At Alpha3D, it is our mission to make 3D content generation, management and deployment experience effortless and seamless for creators, big and small, throughout all platforms and verticals!

Let's build the world of future digital experiences together. It's not magic, it's generative AI.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/madisalesmaa

Since its creation, BAF has held an unwavering belief that our oceans are an integral part of humanity; providing us with nourishment, prosperity, and an honorable means of life. Holding this deep respect for our oceans, the company has stayed true to its moral and ethical compass along its journey as a world leading producer of fresh, sashimi grade Pacific Bluefin Tuna (PBFT); constructively questioning its own business model, strategy, and farm and resources management practices along the way. Currently, BAF holds more than 12 km2 (roughly 3,000 acres) of lease sites for the production of PBFT along the northern Pacific coast of Mexico. 

BAF has played a critical role in not only developing the sustainable aquaculture industry in Mexico but in the recovery story of the PBFT which in 2010 was listed as an at-risk species due to a historically low wild stock; advocating for strict quota management measures and promoting the shift from a commodity trade to a premium product. 

Throughout its journey, BAF has been very prudent about its growth; integrating components into its core business as it expands its capabilities and innovates its business model to enrich its value chain. As a result of deliberate, and exceptionally executed plans, today, BAF is a vertically integrated company with capabilities that span from the spotting and fishing of wild PBFT in Mexican waters, the transfer of live PBFT into holding pens, the fishing of bait fish as fresh feed, the holding, rearing, and slaughter of PBFT, through to the marketing and sales of fresh, premium grade, best choice PBFT. 

BAF´s core philosophy is centered around innovation and continuous improvement as well as an untamed spirit of adventure that demands bravery, ambition, independence, and an intrepid curiosity that drives it to break out of its comfort zone into a never-ending search for new, unmapped horizons.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelhvazquez

Safer: To lower the carbon output, we source water locally instead of shipping it, and purify it with an advanced filtration process. Our water quality beats market standards—and we like to keep things transparent by sharing that data with you.

Healthier: Along with clean water, we then create flavored and carbonated drinks free from microplastics, because our infinite bottles are made from glass or stainless steel.

Province Brands technology allows the company to make food grade sugars from non-starch plant material, specifically cellulose and hemicellulose. This innovation allows 1) the use of plants as initial biomass that are not food sources for the world's population and, 2) allows the use of plants that would be considered waste materials from other manufacturing processes and 3) decrease the overall carbon footprint of the food and beverage industry by reducing carbon emissions and waste disposal costs. In addition, these novel techniques can provide the flavorful and nutritious functional beverages demanded by health-conscious consumers.

To date, Province Brands has created several proof-of-concept foods and beverages. It has created a premium plant-based hemp syrup that proudly competes with Manuka honey, agave syrup and yacon syrup in composition and flavour. Brewing its hemp sugars, the company has also produced the world's first hemp beer, gluten free and lower calorie.
