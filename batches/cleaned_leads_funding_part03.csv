Ceterus provides clear financial insights, tech-enabled bookkeeping, and tax preparation so you can build a stronger future as a franchise or small business owner. 

As a growing business ourselves, we understand the dilemma small business owners face.

When you work with us, we bring you:

Experienced accountants with niche-level expertise in your industry that understand the ins and outs of your business so you don't have to explain them. In other words, we take bookkeeping completely off of your plate from the beginning.


Multi-layer security that ensures your information is protected. We want you to feel safe in making us part of the business you've passionately built from the ground up.


Access to our web and mobile apps so you have all of the information you need to make critical business decisions at your fingertips. Because we know managing a business isn't all done in front of a computer. 
The best part? We price according to your bookkeeping requirements, rather than the size of your business, allowing us to remain simultaneously affordable and worth the price. 
Reach out whenever you're ready to relinquish the guilt of not putting enough time into your financials and work with a team as passionate about your business as you are.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/billjones5

Caitlin,Chair & Chief Executive Officer,caitlinc@otonexus.com,United States,medical devices,3000000.0,OtoNexus Medical Technologies,Caitlin Cameron,2010.0,Seattle,"OtoNexus Medical Technologies is revolutionizing the diagnosis and management of middle ear infections. The OtoNexus technology platform harnesses the power of ultrasound technology to rapidly and accurately determine both the presence and the type of fluid behind the eardrum, providing a superior alternative to outdated diagnostic methods. 

By accurately determining the type of infection, healthcare providers can avoid prescribing antibiotics when they are not needed, helping to combat the growing issues of antibiotic resistance. 

Accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment could reduce healthcare costs by minimizing complications and the need for additional treatments or follow-up visits. Patients will benefit from a faster, non-invasive diagnostic procedure, leading to quicker treatment and potentially shorter recovery times. Healthcare providers will benefit from a reliable and easy-to-use tool that enhances their diagnostic capabilities and supports their decision-making process.

One-use-per-patient proprietary disposable tips incorporating this new patented ultrasound technology create a recurring revenue stream. 

The device is a simple, affordable, portable, lightweight, non-invasive tool that provides data in 1-2 seconds on the type of middle ear infection. With this information, healthcare providers can accurately assess middle ear infections and responsibly treat them with antibiotics when appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-cameron-a3905158

Sitting four stories above a river that takes you straight to the ocean by kayak, we design and build the kind of gear we love to use ourselves.

We take full responsibility for every creative detail of our brand and products. Our team does all product design, engineering, development, studio photography, graphic design, etc. in house. At NEMO, ideas for new products begin with having real experiences in adventure. A passion for adventure is an absolute prerequisite for being part of the team, and the design team at NEMO works by these key principles:

- Never bring anything to market that isn't significantly better than what is already available.
- Own and obsess over every detail.
- Be proud of what you do.

We believe adventure gives us purpose and perspective. It makes us humble and proud. We're committed to the fearless pursuit of uncharted paths, in everything from the equipment we build to the way we run our business. Bravely exploring new directions opens our minds, brings us closer to the people we depend on, sharpens our wits, and lifts our spirits.

Twilight Wish was founded in Doylestown, PA in 2003 by Cass Forkin after her chance encounter with several elderly women in a diner.

Twilight Wish fulfills wish requests for deserving seniors who are 65 and older or a permanent resident of a nursing facility.  Wish recipents must also have a history of giving back to their community and an annual income of less than 200% of poverty level. 

Wishes granted range from simple basic needs wishes such as eyeglasses or a lift chair to more elaborate lifelong wishes such as meeting a favorite baseball player or a ride in a fighter jet. Sometimes a wish fulfills an immediate need and sometimes it is a last wish.  Large or small, all wishes provide a meaningful ""thank you""​ to the senior for a lifetime of service to others.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/cass-forkin-b817aa3

The company is most focused on Creatv Bio Division, and its mission is to dramatically reduce global cancer mortality.

Our innovative LifeTracDx® blood test can detect cancer in the earliest stages before symptoms. It can also confirm whether a patient is responding to treatment and surveils for early signs of recurrence after treatment has finished. Creatv Bio also developed a wide spectrum of cancer diagnostics to improve patient care. Clinical application of this highly sensitive and specific test will improve cancer treatment outcomes.
 
Cancer touches all of us. Almost 40% of Americans develop cancer in their lifetime. Over half of these diagnoses occur after significant progression, in stages 3 and 4, making it difficult to achieve successful therapeutic outcomes. Early detection with high accuracy is needed for all major cancers. 

Nearly 18 million Americans are living with a history of cancer, many in remission under surveillance for possible recurrence. Early detection of recurrence enables faster response and improved outcomes. 

LifeTracDx® liquid biopsy platform uncovered a previously unknown cell in the blood of cancer patients, the cancer associated macrophage-like cell (CAML). These cells are very large and distinctly different from normal cells and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CAMLs are found in patients with cancer, but not in healthy individuals. CAMLs are highly informative, because they contain markers of the cancer type and indicate sensitivity or resistance to particular treatments. Unlike CTCs, CAMLs are found in all stages of cancer, including stage I. 

Together, CAMLs and CTCs provide a unique capability for early detection of cancer, monitoring treatment, and watching for recurrence. LifeTracDx® will be available in a CLIA lab by the beginning of the second quarter of 2025.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/cha-mei-tang-70670424b

Concerto unlocks this knowledge with kChip, a discovery engine that physically constructs millions of miniature, defined microbial communities simultaneously. By observing the behavior of each community, Concerto rapidly identifies the most promising microbes, prebiotics, and postbiotics for development into new products. In our first endeavor, Concerto constructed >6 million communities of skin-dwelling microbes to discover an eczema-alleviating ""ensemble"" of bacteria that pacifies pathogenic S. aureus. We have since initiated discovery projects in vaginal health, gut health, and agriculture. In partnership with a diverse array of biotech and biopharma companies, Concerto aims to unleash a new era of microbial research and a treasure trove of microbe-based products.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/cheriackerman
