West Side Forward> is Bethel's strategic initiative to transform Chicago's West Side by substantially reducing poverty utilizing tactics that will move 63,000 people into skilled work that can sustain their families.

To achieve our mission, West Side Forward> focuses on four key tactics:
-- Creating 36,000 new West Side Jobs and 90,000 jobs across Chicago in a decade
-- Preparing 116,000 West Side residents for jobs in high demand, growth industries that pay a family living wage
-- Connecting 63,000 residents to jobs that pay at least $36,000 per year
-- Supporting residents once in jobs to ensure a steady state increase of 63,000 in our communities

The price of poverty is high. To face the coming economic challenges, the U.S. needs to build a workforce that can compete in the 21st century and enable all of its citizens to contribute their talents and skills. Yet, this is something that we are struggling to do, in large part because tens of millions of Americans live in poverty. And in terms of poverty, Chicago's West Side communities are among the most disadvantaged in the City.
-- Bethel support 5 neighborhoods on Chicago's West Side: Austin, East and West Garfield Park, Humboldt Park and North Lawndale
-- 210,000 people live in these communities, encompassing 16 sq miles
-- Poverty and unemployment rates are more than twice those seen in the City overall
-- Per capita income is less than half of that of Chicago
-- More than 60% of residents have a HS education or less

Transforming the West Side of Chicago will take substantial, focused investment in getting West Side residents employed in skilled jobs. We need your help to achieve the goals of West Side Forward>.

It is currently estimated that only 5% of companies offer this benefit, although 42% of the workforce has at least one child dependent on them for care.  Backup Care allows employees to hire highly vetted caregivers to come to their homes and care for family members when they experience a breakdown in their regular care structure.   This service bridges the care gap caused by school closures, illnesses, travel for work, and can even include Pet Care and Tutoring Support Services.  Backup Care is provided to children, parents, or any other adult dependent of an employee.

CorporateCARE Solutions is unique in the payment structure we offer for employers.  We believe all employers should be able to afford this benefit for employees, so we have a Pay-As-You-Go model and never have a utilization minimum.  This valuable benefit ensures employees no longer miss work unexpectedly due to breakdowns in family care. Knowing they can leave their loved ones at home with a professional caregiver enables them to be on the job with true peace of mind.

UNMET NEED
Although there have been considerable advancements in developing therapies to lower ""bad"" cholesterol in the past 25 years, a significant number of patients are either unresponsive or experience concerning side effects with current treatment options, including statins.  To address these concerns, more aggressive and selective targeted therapies are needed. One promising avenue for developing specific LDL-C lowering agents is the LDL receptor (LDLR) degradation pathway, which is primarily mediated by the critical regulatory protein known as PCSK9. PCSK9 controls the degradation of the LDLR in the liver and thereby contributes to cholesterol homeostasis. 

TARGET PCSK9
Several strategies have been tried for targeting PCSK9. Most have focused on the development of injectable biologics.  The most successful approach is the injection of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that interfere with the function of PCSK9.  To date, however, no orally bioavailable anti-PCSK9 drug has advanced to the clinic. We have pursued proprietary approaches and identified an orally bioavailable, first-in-class small molecule lead compound, P-21 that interferes with the function of PCSK9.

LOWER CHOLESTEROL
Shifa's oral small molecule lead compound significantly lowers LDL-C; it is as potent as the injectable monoclonal antibody.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sherin-abdel-meguid-36618a2

Today, large enterprises, schools and organizations – including many of the largest US tech companies and other Fortune 500 companies – use Ambient.ai to secure property, people, and assets from the most harrowing physical security threats.

Expanding on recent breakthroughs in crucial neurodegenerative pathways, we are positioned to deliver transformative neuroprotective therapies to prevent and protect against neuronal loss and related neuroimmune dysregulation. Our research and development strategy is currently centered on two approaches: prevention of neuronal loss to preserve neurological function; and restoring the function of the neuron-glia axis to improve the nervous system's immune surveillance capacity in response to neurological injury. Our discovery engine and emerging multi-target pipeline spans these approaches and is well positioned to address a broad range of neurological diseases. Nura Bio's lead program is the SARM1 inhibitor program. SARM1, has recently emerged an axon-intrinsic metabolic sensor that is a pivotal driver of axonal degeneration and neuronal integrity.

Matrix removes the potential for Source of Income discrimination, taking the subsidy into consideration and automating the underwriting process.
