Accelerating R&D matters because materials are essential to improve our lives and tackle some of humanity's biggest challenges.

We need better materials to develop a) more affordable batteries that last longer and are not toxic; b) more efficient solar cells that can be deployed everywhere; and c) more effective carbon capture, use and sequestration tech. Similarly, to discover new medicines and vaccines, we need to find the optimal conditions to hit the right molecules.

We know that effective teambuilding activities mean much more than a fun outing or team event. They're the foundation of enhanced performance, not just for the company as a whole, but for each individual who participates. 

This is especially meaningful now, when many teams and departments are split across multiple locations and companies are embracing remote or hybrid work models. People aren't getting that valuable opportunity to touch base, bond, and get to know each other better – which means companies are suffering from poor teamwork and a deteriorating workplace culture.

But where can you find a teambuilding activity that actually walks the walk and gets those results, instead of leaving everyone more stressed and divided than they were before? That's where we come in, with diverse customizable programs that are being used by over 1,500 companies worldwide, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay, Oracle, and more.

We help companies build better teams and workplaces, with interactive activities designed to encourage outside-the-box thinking while improving collaboration, communication, creativity, and problem-solving. 

•	Our unique technology offers a wide variety of dynamic challenges that inspire teams to be creative and try new things.
•	Every activity can be fully customized to suit your brand identity, location, industry, location, event messages, and more.
•	No special devices or app download required, just bring your phone, comfy shoes, and positive energy!

4D Path's cloud-based, quantitative approach is intended to eliminate the need for additional molecular tests (e.g., immunohistochemistry, FISH, RNA-Seq, NGS), accelerating complete, actionable and objective insight leading to expedited and democratized precision medicine. 4D Path's quantitative approach is designed to provide clinical solutions in both companion diagnostics and translational medicine without compromising the current standard of care to reduce the cost, time and complexity of patient care and management, and clinical trials. 

Our patented methods and integrated platform combine universal physics, biology and mathematical principles to identify tumor-specific phenotypic and genotypic fingerprints in order to inform treatment selection and stratify patients accordingly. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 4D Path Breakthrough Device Designation for our first software-as-a-medical-device solution, the 4D Q-plasia OncoReader Breast, which demonstrates promise of significant improvements over the existing standard of care by providing histopathologists with an adjunct technology to improve diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer features (e.g., its invasiveness, grades, etc.) solely from digitized histopathology images obtained via biopsies or resections.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopo-leonardi-2956a79

Jaehyeok,CEO,jhyeok.kim@letinar.com,United States,electrical/electronic manufacturing,1000000.0,LetinAR,Jaehyeok Kim,2016.0,Cambridge,"LetinAR develops an optical system for AR smart glasses, which plays the same role as smartphone displays. The optical system consists of LetinAR's self-developed ""Pin Mirror (""PinMR™"") lens"" and a microdisplay made by external partners.
Current smartglasses manufacturers use traditional optical systems such as Half-mirror, Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs), and waveguides to build the devices. Under-par performance of those optical systems has hardly satisfied users and experts. The bulky body, narrow Field of View (FOV), complicated manufacturing process, and inaccurate color expression have long been a stumbling block for successful commercialization of AR smart glasses. 
LetinAR PinMR™"" lens is set to replace such displays. The company has applied the so-called ""Pinhole Effect"" to tiny mirrors and embedded them with eyeglass lenses. Respective PinMR™ reflects the light from a microdisplay and guides the light into human pupils. Users may view the virtual image from the microdisplay as well as the image from the real world at ease. Human eyes cannot detect the mirrors because the mirrors are smaller than human pupils. Only the virtual image formed by the light reflected by those mirrors becomes visual. 
With LetinAR PinMR™ lens, manufacturers can build smartglasses worn like a pair of conventional glasses. The simple structure of PinMR™ Lens module can facilitate mass production. PinMR™ Lens shows wider virtual screen than the currently available optical systems while more accurately expressing colors – an edge over diffraction-based or refraction-based systems from competitors. PinMR™ Lens can also show a clear image without inducing dizziness because it is able to extend the Depth of Field (DOF) multiple times. 
LetinAR plans to supply PinMR™ Lens as a complete module, which consists of PinMR™ lens and a microdisplay from external partners.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/jhyeok

We work super-hard to design, source, produce, offer, and deliver what we think are the greatest products on the planet. 

Ann and I have always loved finding and making great things to share with people – in short, making a connection with everyone. We've had this itch since we were young, making mix tapes and organizing parties. Together, we opened a single shop on the west side of Atlanta in 2007... and then we kept going. 

Because you don't need a lot of choices... you just need the right choices.

We'd had this sort of mental, analog Pinterest board brewing since we met, of all the things we loved and wanted to put together in one place. So when we began, we knew it wasn't only about making cool, special, useful things. It was about the curating of them, making the selection a little less daunting, a little easier, even fun. 

SID and ANN shops opened in Houston in winter 2013, Georgetown, Washington, D.C. and Dallas, in fall 2015. In fall 2016 a Sid Mashburn-only men's shop opened in the Brentwood Country Mart in LA, and during winter 2022 the NYC SID and ANN shop opened on the Upper East Side in Manhattan.

In addition to the retail locations, the e-commerce shop at www.shopmashburn.com serves customers from all over the world. 

Ours is a simple concept: a combination of our own designed-and-produced clothing (shirting, trousers, footwear, accessories, made-to-measure tailored clothing) and our favorite classic, iconic, and hard-to-find pieces... all in a space designed to feel as beautiful, inspiring, and welcoming as possible.

Jeanna,Founder,jeanna@broadwayweekends.com,United States,performing arts,,Broadway Weekends,Jeanna Waal,2018.0,,"Broadway Weekends was founded in 2017 as a ""Theater Camp For Adults.""

It aimed to create an experience inspired by all aspects of Broadway training and a Broadway show rehearsal process, while being easily accessible to non-professionals.

Developed in partnership with working theater practitioners, the company began by exploring structures and schedules that emulated a creative theater environment while being easily accessible to non-professionals.

During the pandemic, BW moved online and hosted a virtual schedule. The schedule included 20 - 30 weekly theater classes, reaching students from across 46 countries for over 18 months. From dawn to dusk, students tuned in from multiple time zones to take theater classes together, forming the ""BWAH community"" which is still active today. 

YOU COME TO US:
Summer Camps are offered in a 5 and 2 Day format, creating an experience inspired by all aspects of Broadway training and a Broadway show rehearsal process, while being easily accessible to non-professionals. All participants must be 18 and there is no upper age limit. 

WE COME TO YOU:
BW organizes and creates personalized workshops that bring top theater talent directly to your community.
