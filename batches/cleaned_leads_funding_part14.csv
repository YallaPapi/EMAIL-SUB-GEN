Audits and assurance functions cannot be efficient without a collaboration between audit firms & their clients. Both parties have internal solutions to manage their distinct audit processes. But they rely on emails & document sharing tools with manual processes to communicate & collaborate during audit. Many firms have to work with multiple auditors and need to have an army of professionals to manually collect data for periodic reporting to the Chief Risk Officer & the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
This is exactly why the Audit Manager is a must have solution. It enables auditors to work with all their clients using a simple process. They can issue, track and manage findings.
All stakeholders in an organization using the Audit Manager can directly communicate securely within the portal with role based access controls and simple workflows for the entire audit lifecycle. Users can digitally communicate and exchange any type of data & documents including multimedia and AR/VR technologies to enable remote audit and compliance.
Utilize our growing library of regulations from over 60 agencies and integrated private libraries of your policies and procedures for traceability.
The onboarding process includes initial configuration, support for data uploads, web-based training and online ticket based support. Adopt BCube today to save millions of dollars annually and modernize your audit and compliance.

Our mission is to get freshly harvested, heirloom spices that were grown for their flavor and aroma into your hands as quickly and ethically as possible. As of 2021, we work with roughly 150 farm partners and over 1000 farm partners across 10 states in India & Sri Lanka. 



Growing a better spice trade - from small Indian farms to your kitchen.


We put flavor first - for hundreds of years the spice trade has prioritized high volume and profits at the expense of taste. We work with heirloom seed varieties, and in constant collaboration with our partner farms to curate only the most delicious spices grown for flavor first. 

Equality is at the heart of our work - we pay our partner farms an average of 6x the market price for their produce. We recognize that the commodity food system is broken, and that as leaders in sustainability and regenerative ag, our partner farmers deserve a rich premium, as well as harvest advances, and full healthcare for all their laborers. 

We take our time - we spend anywhere from 6 months - 2 years sourcing a new spice - making several farm visits and always in search of true excellence. If we don't find a good enough spice, we don't launch it. Simple. 

Culture matters - South Asian flavors, stories and foodways are heroically underrepresented in the grocery and kitchen landscape. We're giving context, nuance and color to the cuisines of our homelands and diaspora.

With prices falling by 80% in less than a decade, solar power is now within reach of every American household.

Here's the problem: 90 million American households are currently locked out of the solar marketplace. Maybe it's because they rent their homes. Or other solar companies are not willing to sell to them. Or simply because their roof is in the shade or is not well-suited to a solar array.

Our mission is to unlock the possibility of solar power for these households.  

With the help of transformative policies taking root in the United States, we are now in a position to do so.  It's called ""community solar.""​  What it means is that a household can buy solar power without having an array installed on its roof.  

Here's what we noticed: in communities all across the country, there are extraordinary organizations -- from the church down the street to the college campus across town -- that are embracing clean energy and want to bring it to their constituents.  There are also households that want to go solar but do not have an easy way to do so.  Finally, there are solar companies eager to find more customers.

Our goal as Solstice is to use community solar to help these groups meet one another. 

When we do, everybody wins: those who cannot currently access solar are brought into the market, more solar is deployed, and everyone saves on their electricity bills.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandhyamurali

The EnPlace® approach is much simpler to perform – and much easier to recover from - than the current standard of care dissection approach.

 The Problem: Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) is a painful, debilitating medical condition that occurs when the normal support of the vagina is lost, resulting in the ""sagging"" or dropping of the female pelvic organs. POP is a very common and bothersome condition facing many women.

 The Unmet Need: A Simple and Safe Pelvic Floor Repair System. The current standard of care includes hysterectomy or complicated mesh surgery. Mesh has been associated with pain, bleeding and other complications. In 2011, the FDA issued warnings regarding transvaginal mesh and many products were withdrawn from the market, leaving few good options. Many women believe they must live with the pain and discomfort due to the lack of simple, safe solutions.

The Market: It is estimated that the lifetime prevalence for a woman is between 30-50%. The global market for the devices is $10 billion and is growing due to the aging population.

Unique approach: FEMSelect's EnPlace® is both FDA-cleared and CE Marked.  EnPlace® is a truly minimally-invasive surgical system that is simpler than the current standard of care. The surgery is conducted with no deep dissection and no mesh. The device is a combination of a Nitinol-based anchor, surgical sutures and an innovative method of attachment.  EnPlace® was tested in a large Post-Marketing Study in the US, Germany and Israel and is now available commercially in the US and Israel.  The EnPlace® technology is protected by global and US patents.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sasha-schrode-28589a13

Mendoza Ventures is an early-stage and growth venture fund based in Boston. The firm is run by husband and wife Adrian and Senofer Mendoza, entrepreneurs and prior operators who are veterans of the local startup ecosystem. The firm focuses on investments in fintech, AI, and cybersecurity, with diversity playing an important role in their investment decisions—about 70% of their portfolio consists of startups led by immigrants, people of color, and women. Mendoza started off as a pilot fund in 2016; after an exit and the realization that they had good traction with early-stage startups in Boston, Adrian and Senofer decided to focus exclusively on the seed-stage and formally launched Mendoza Ventures Fund II in 2019. Since then, the firm has made twelve investments and recruited senior managers, C-level executives, and domain experts as operating partners from places like State Street, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft.

Firm strategy
Mendoza Ventures takes a depth-focused approach, looking for founders who demonstrate domain expertise in one of their three main focus areas across fintech, AI, and cybersecurity. Adrian and Senofer pride themselves on being hands-on investors and setting up companies for success beyond just writing a check—they will help create a strong early funding syndicate, make customer introductions, and assist with partnership conversations. They really tap into their experience as former entrepreneurs to get in the trenches with their founders, with Adrian optimizing business structures and Senofer leveraging her sales and marketing expertise.
