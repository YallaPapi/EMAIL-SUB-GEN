The Teralytic probe generates real-time data collection and analysis of all soil types, anywhere in the field. Using 26 sensors to provide the most detailed soil quality data available, it reports on soil moisture, salinity, and NPK at three different depths, as well as aeration, respiration, air temperature, light, and humidity.

Returns are a multi-billion-dollar problem for Ready-To-Wear (""RTW"") apparel companies. Customers report that the #1 reason for returns is wrong size or fit.

Returns have high reverse logistics costs that often lead to a destruction decision as the lowest cost option. This is a growing ESG problem for companies and B-Corps.

Bodidata was created to solve the complex problem of matching different body shapes and sizes to RTW clothing, and because we understand the ""Complexity of Fit"" and the issues associated with matching infinite body shapes into RTW clothing, we know that accurate measurement is only one of the requirements for successful size-matching.

Debt was nothing new to them, as growing up in single parent homes, it was engraved in them that ""you would always owe someone"".  Determined to break the generational curses which preceded them, the couple decided to come up with a game plan to get out of debt.  Because trying to save money with $100K in debt was a lose-lose situation.

The initial step was hiring a financial advisor and coming face-to-face with the number of loans and the amounts owed.  If there was any feeling of embarrassment or being ashamed, being transparent together as a couple made the exercise far more invaluable and deepened their personal relationship beyond numbers on a piece of paper.  

By leveraging Dave Ramsey's principles, the debts were prioritized from smallest to largest including interest rates and the couple set a goal of when they wanted to become debt free.  In addition, they set a realistic budget and their journey to becoming debt free began.  Seven years later and the couple became debt free!  

In sharing their testimony with family and friends, they realized that others were suffering from the same debt burdens.  God gave the vision to SpenDebt's Founder to create a tool to help people pay off debt in parallel with their spending habits.  The Co-Founder completed a simulation to test the idea and SpenDebt was born.

Without becoming debt free, the now married couple would not have had the opportunity to see beyond the debt and provide a tool to allow people to become debt free.  The couple is on a mission to turn generational curses into generational wealth.  Becoming debt free not only increases your bank account but it opens doors and provides the ability for you to make a greater impact on the world.

CoinRegTech is a provider of regulatory technology (""RegTech"") to the virtual currency marketplace. Our platform provides compliance monitoring to ensure your regulatory obligations are properly met.

WHAT WE DO.
The Problem
Virtual currency was deemed a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. A commodity transaction must actually deliver within a 28-day period to qualify for an exception from CFTC oversight. The CFTC is seeking to reconcile its actual delivery exception with ownership transfers of virtual currency.

Our Solution
CoinRegTech operates independently from execution platforms and market participants. Subject to final CFTC Guidance, CoinRegTech will verify the ownership of virtual currency (on-chain and off-chain transactions) in accordance with the actual delivery exception. CoinRegTech is designed to meet applicable regulations, and support the forthcoming compliance obligations for market participants.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/virginia-persons

Vishesh,Founder & CEO,vishesh@cloudfiles.io,India,information technology & services,,CloudFiles,Vishesh Singhal,2021.0,Bengaluru,"A Sales team typically uses 5-6 document tools:

1. Document generation tool for creating personalized proposal/contracts etc. using a template & customer data. Ex: Conga composer, Panda Docs, Quip. 
2. Document Storage tool for storing files in a cloud storage. Ex: SharePoint, Google Drive, Salesforce. 
3. Document Discovery tool for finding the right content in the business context. Ex: Seismic, Highspot. 
4. Document Sharing tool for sharing documents with customers & tracking engagement. Ex: Showpad, DocSend. 
5. E-signatures tool to Esign on documents. Ex: DocuSign, HelloSign
    
Problems with current document stack is that: 

1. These tools don't talk to each other. 
2. They add a lot of friction to the sales process. 
3. Sales people have to keep jumping between these tools. 
4. Sensitive files & customer data is scattered across these platforms. 
5. They don't integrate well with the existing processes. 

Enter CloudFiles which is a full stack document automation & sharing platform. It is:

a) Friction Eliminator: 
1. Exposed through the CRMs - acts as CRM extension & not as a new tool
2. Mirrors existing storage - Works on top of SharePoint, Google Drive etc. Customer's sensitive files remain with them.

b) Deeply Integrated:
1. CRMs are very powerful at automations, it's their core business. 
2. CloudFiles deeply integrates with these tools, harnessing the full power of CRMs. 

c) Full Stack:
1. CloudFiles would support all functions across document lifecycle, with an option to plug user's own tool as well. 
2. Ex: Someone wants to use DocuSign instead of our e-signatures, they can, in a seamless way. 

d) Highly Customizable:
1. All sales processes are unique. Salesforce understood that and pioneered CRMs. 
2. CloudFiles takes the same approach, building on top of CRMs, enabling customers to fully customize their processes involving documents.

Many cancers create immune exclusion barriers that prevent the immune system from attacking tumors. Our approach to overcoming these barriers is to modulate the interplay among cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells.  
  
Our lead program, PRTH-101, is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) with collagen, thereby ""punching holes"" in the extracellular matrix barrier created by the tumor. With the extracellular matrix barrier breached, immune cells are able to infiltrate and attack the tumor.  PRTH-101 is poised to enter Phase 1 clinical trials.  
 
PRTH-101 is followed by a pipeline of preclinical projects targeting orthogonal components of the tumor microenvironment that promote immune exclusion.  

Incendia combines its drug discovery and development efforts with a precision oncology approach to get the right medicines to the right patients.

We think that if hydrogen is going to replace fossil fuels then safety and non-toxicity should be the central requirement.

Hydrilyte is is the most cost competitive storage solution for renewable firming. 

On a renewable grid, powered by wind and/or solar PV, energy storage is required to ""fill the gaps"" when power from generation falls below the load. This is known as ""renewable firming"". Where the gaps are in the order of seconds to hours, batteries and/or super capacitors provide a cost effective and technically efficient solution. However, batteries don't have the energy density to economically meet longer term (> 4 hour) shortfalls. Fossil fuels are typically used to cover these longer periods that may extend to many days.
