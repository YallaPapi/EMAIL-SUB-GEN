Our team builds smart sensors that help utility companies to immediately detect, find, and fix outages and take steps to prevent new outages, and other related disasters, from happening at all. The need for power will only increase. We protect the grid of today while we build the grid of tomorrow.

My husband and I are active and travel often. Once our daughter was born I quickly came to the realization that traveling with an infant was extremely difficult.
One of the biggest struggles we had was our daughter refused to drink anything that was not warm. Trying to find warm water when out and about didn't seem like that difficult of a task, until we tried to. If we did find someone who could warm water up for us it would always take forever or be scalding hot from the coffee machine. When you have a crying baby time is of the essence.
So we went out on a search to find something that was small portable and battery powered so we didn't get tied down to the cord. Well after hours of searching we came to the realization that this did not exist. Frustrated we were always concerned when going out and honestly missed out on a lot of things just because we were scared we wouldn't be able to find warm water near us.
Fast forward to today, we have poured our heart and soul into The Baby's Brew. Not only does it heat water it doubles as formula storage as well. No more measuring out formula before leaving the house and no more wasting formula!
The Baby's Brew is the First Ever battery powered bottle warmer. Since every baby is different we made our bottle warmer adjust to their needs. You have the option of 3 different temperatures 98.6F, 104F, or my daughter's favorite temp 114F. You can warm up water on the go or maintain the temperature for up to 5 hours. Perfect when going on hikes or just exploring downtown.
So don't be tied down by the cord get The Baby's Brew and get out!",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alainamoulton

What is oleocanthal?

Oleocanthal is the secret ingredient you never knew you needed.
Oleocanthal is known to be responsible for the health benefits associated with olive oil. It has shown, in many studies, to have therapeutic efficacy against Alzheimer's, certain cancers, inflammatory diseases, and who knows what else!

Why do we care?

Oleolive is made up of dedicated scientists and business professionals who share a sense of responsibility and dedication to bringing about innovative advances and solutions to better people's lives.

What is the plan?

Oleocanthal is difficult to acquire and is usually of poor quality. Under our exclusive license (Thank you, University of Louisiana at Monroe!) we produce exceptional oleocanthal enabling other researchers to begin experimenting with its potential and usefulness.
Oleolive has also formulated an oleocanthal-rich supplement, Oligen, to deliver to consumers directly.
We will additionally continue to study oleocanthal's effects on Alzheimer's disease and plan to develop a commercially available treatment.

Along with our multiple options for adult testing, we have newborn (perinatal) drug testing that can detect substance abuse exposure in the last 20 weeks of pregnancy by testing a small piece of a newborn's umbilical cord, potentially creating an opportunity for critical intervention when the mother might be most prone to seeking treatment. The ChildGuard hair test can detect up to 3 months of passive exposure to substances abuse, which could help support advocates seeking a safer environment. Adult drug testing ranges from lower levels of substances very recently ingested -urine- to higher levels of substance ingested 3-6 months prior – nail, hair, and dried blood spot.

Our History

Founder and CEO of Protein For Pets (P4P), Marco Giannini, is leaving an indelible print in the world of natural pet food and supplies while reinventing how people shop for them.

Giannini launched Protein For Pets in early 2014 and the now seven-store-strong company has locations open in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Anaheim, Rancho Cucamonga, Laguna Niguel, San Clemente and Ventura.  New locations in Valencia, Santa Clarita and Rancho San Diego are among those set to open their doors within the next few months.

But Giannini's forward-thinking commitment to enhancing the health and well-being of pets began more than a decade when he founded his first company, Dogswell in 2003.  After a modest beginning selling dog treats out of his car, Giannini went on to turn what became a national brand specializing in nutrient and supplement filled dog food and treats, from a half million dollar company within its first year to tens of millions when he sold it at the end of 2008. Giannini continued as CEO of Dogswell until leaving the company in 2013 to create Protein For Pets.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alejo-tello-ba168615b

Alex,"President, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-Founder",gsturmer@elysiumrx.com,United States,biotechnology,,"Elysium Therapeutics, Inc.",Alex Sturmer,2013.0,Denver,"Elysium's mission is to reduce suffering from severe acute pain, opioid-use disorder (OUD), and fatal opioid overdose by developing first- or best-in-class products with profiles that address the key limitations and dangers associated with opioids used today. Our pipeline consists of 3 diverse platforms with broad applicability across several areas of significant unmet need:
 
Technologies
1. O2P™ (Oral Overdose Protection) – Lead platform	Traditional opioids are easy to abuse, with euphoria and risk of respiratory depression increasing with every pill consumed.	O2P provides self-limiting exposure to active opioid and prevents overdose. 
2. XpiRx™ (Forced Expiration)	70-year half-life of traditional opioids creates a surplus supply of readily available pills that can end up on the streets.	XpiRx opioids, whose potency expires after the prescribed-use period, reduce abuse and prevent fatal overdoses.
3. SOOPR™ (Synthetic Opioid Overdose Prevention and Rescue)	Existing rescue agents are too short-acting and weak against synthetic opioids, often requiring multiple doses.	SOOPR lasts up to 24 hours and is more effective against synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl, nitazenes) than today's standard-of-care
  
Elysium has a highly attractive risk/reward profile:
 
1.       High-probability of Success: In vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept data for its new chemical entities that are comprised of FDA-approved drugs
2.       Capital Efficiency: Leveraging non-dilutive grant funding, ~$16M to-date
3.       Platform Opportunity: Diversified portfolio of programs addressing the key underlying factors that are driving the opioid crisis and could yield multiple products within 3-5 years
4.       Market: Multi-billion-dollar market potential, with weak direct pipeline competition
5.       Intellectual Property: Strong protection, with issued patents in the US and internationally, including composition of matter",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-greg-sturmer-04a7948
