Nigel,Chief Executive Officer,nigel.macclancy@precidiag.com,United States,research,,Piton Therapeutics,Nigel Macclancy,2016.0,Boston,"Piton (""Pee-ton"") is pioneering the development of life-changing, first-in-class therapeutics for chronic conditions with limited therapeutic options. 

The company employs a proprietary platform to discern the gut microbiome's role in the cause and progression of disease. Therapeutics are developed to precisely target pathogenic pathways in the gut lumen. AI capabilities efficiently identify drug candidates with desired characteristics which are validated in the company's lab. 

Products consist of small molecule drugs. Piton does NOT develop live bacterial therapeutics (LBTs) or seek to modify the composition of microbiota in the gut.

Piton's lead pipelines, IBD/Ulcerative Colitis & Autism Spectrum Disorder, target unmet needs in markets with 5 million and 50+ million patients, respectively. Parkinson's Disease constitutes a third area of focus.

Piton's therapeutic approach for Ulcerative Colitis uniquely targets a cause of the disease for a sub-type constituting ~45% of the patient population. The approach has strong support in the clinical community and represents a potential ‘paradigm change' in the treatment of the disease. In-human trials are anticipated in 2025.

Recently published research suggests that Piton's therapeutic strategy for UC may have application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight loss management.

Piton's therapeutic approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder has been validated in successive, in-vivo experiments. Several drug candidates are under consideration for what could be the first approved drug to treat the core symptoms of ASD.

Application of Piton's discovery platform for Parkinson's Disease led to the discovery of a causative hypothesis and a target for novel therapeutic intervention. Given strong links between this hypothesis and many chronic diseases, including Intestinal Bowel Disease (IBD), this program may hold cross-disease blockbuster potential.

GAIMIN Empowers Gamers Leveraging Web3 Technology in Building the Future of Cloud Computing | Top 5 Esports Organization Gaimin Gladiators

Large Scale Decentralized Processing Power... From Our All-In-One Gamer Solution

The Gaimin.io Project Overview

The Gaimin.io project connects the world's largest decentralized processing power supply, which belongs to the 1.5 billion gaming PCs in the global gaming community, with the rapidly growing, worldwide demand for massive processing power.

What is the Gaimin Platform?

The Gaimin.io platform is a Windows-based software application for a PC gamer that allows him to monetize his resources (processing power) when not being used. It then gives him a complete environment to spend his rewards to enhance his gaming fun, including the purchase of games and gaming assets via the integrated marketplace and community.

How Does it Work?

Once downloaded and installed, the Gaimin.io platform auto-connects the gamer's PC to our ""Monetization Network"" allowing the gamer to contribute their unused processing power passively.

The Gaimin.io ""A.I. Engine"" then directs this processing power to monetization opportunities, such as computations that confirm and validate blockchain transactions or video rendering tasks that require large amounts of computational power... And because the platform only activates when the gamer's resources are not being used, it doesn't affect gaming performance in any way.

The gamer is rewarded for contributing their processing capacity with Gaimin.io's native GMRX tokens, which can then be used as purchasing power within the Gaimin.gg marketplace and community in order to purchase games, NFTs, gaming assets, and for ""user-to-user"" transactions (buy, sell, rent).

Where Can I See More Information?

By doing so, they unlock the value of the industry's idle vehicle capacity, which is a lost opportunity of $5B annually in the US alone and estimated at $35B globally. 

Having improved bus travel for millions of riders to date, Rally and OurBus united through an acquisition to create the leading technology company for mass mobility in the United States. The companies capture market share by meeting or surpassing the modern consumer's expectations of easy online booking, customer-centric policies, high quality operators, and a technology-oriented approach to the entire customer journey. 

Rally and OurBus have established new consumer brands in busing built for the sharing economy. Together, they provide a single technology platform affecting the private bus industry's 700M annual passenger trips. They empower the 3,000+ small businesses that comprise the US private bus industry.

Sequoia invented the LISST series of aquatic science sensors in 1995. Since then, more than 40 different types of sensors have been developed, prototyped, or manufactured by Sequoia. Today, thousands of Sequoia instruments are in use, helping ocean and freshwater scientists and managers around the world better understand our oceans and the aquatic environment. All design and production takes place in our Bellevue, WA location. Our sales staff is located in Bellevue, WA and Mobile, AL.

LISST was originally an acronym for our laser particle sizing sensors (Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissometry). LISST now is ‘just' a Sequoia trade name. Most of our instruments still use lasers in one way or the other to make measurements. A few use LED's or acoustics. Sometimes two methodologies are used together.

Several of our instruments measure the in-situ size and/or concentration of suspended particles – sediment grains, algae, flocs, oil droplets, air bubbles, aeolian sediment, drilling fluids etc. One model takes pretty particle pictures using holography. Others again measure water optical properties such as beam attenuation, Volume Scattering Function (VSF), and hyperspectral backscatter. The instruments are primarily used for ocean science and freshwater research and for environmental monitoring. However, some are used in select industries in a range of drilling fluid, hydropower, and general process control applications.

How do you know if you need a LISST? Are you an oceanographer, limnologist, biogeochemist, geographer, geologist, soil scientist or coastal, environmental, consulting or drilling engineer? Or do you have an interest in (suspended) particle measurements or the optical properties of water? Or do you work in Industrial Process?

To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics. 

For licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities. 

For AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo's patented system offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost.

Companies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.  

For patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations. 

With DataNovo, companies are able to obtain stronger, more defensible patents, challenge frivolous lawsuits, assess critical licensing or infringing intelligence, and make informed business and strategic decisions throughout the companies'​ life cycles.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandr-loginov-b8910818a
