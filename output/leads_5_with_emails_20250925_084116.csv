Kevin,CEO & CoFounder,kevin@decisely.com,http://www.decisely.com,Atlanta,"Decisely is reimagining the way brokers and small businesses work together. The Decisely solution provides the best combination of benefits, HR resources, and technology to support small businesses.",human resources,2015,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinjdunn,Kevin + $60M Raise + SMB benefits,"Hey Kevin — saw Decisely secure $60M and expand E-Verify/e-doc and ICHRA capabilities to support thousands of small businesses. I wanted to run something by you since SMBs often pause enrollments when benefits get complex or budgets tighten, and those stalled leads sit cold in the CRM. We run a database reactivation service that re-engages inactive prospects with light SMS/email follow-ups timed to product updates and compliance features. For Decisely, it’s a way to turn paused conversations into active clients—without adding headcount—by highlighting the new compliance and ICHRA value. Would you like a 3-minute Loom that shows how it works? No pressure either way. -{{sendingAccountFirstName}}",Kevin
