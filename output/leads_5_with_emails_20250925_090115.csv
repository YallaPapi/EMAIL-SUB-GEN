Kevin,CEO & CoFounder,kevin@decisely.com,http://www.decisely.com,Atlanta,"Decisely is reimagining the way brokers and small businesses work together. The Decisely solution provides the best combination of benefits, HR resources, and technology to support small businesses.",human resources,2015,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinjdunn,Kevin + Decisely ICHRA + SMB benefits,"Hey Kevin — saw Decisely expand healthcare offerings with Decisely ICHRA to give small employers more flexible benefits. I wanted to run something by you since SMB buyers often pause when benefits complexity or budget uncertainty pops up, and hiring teams delay enrollment while they shop options. We run a database reactivation service that re-engages those inactive leads with light SMS/email follow-ups tied to product updates and platform improvements. For Decisely, it’s a way to turn stalled SMB prospects into active enrollments without adding headcount. Would you like me to send a 3-minute Loom that shows how it works? No pressure either way. -Alex",Kevin
