I wanted to run something by you since teams launching niche underwriting programs often have brokers or pilot partners who paused interest when priorities shifted or rollouts slowed. We run a database reactivation service that re-engages those inactive contacts with light SMS/email follow-ups tied to program updates, new capacity, or expansion into UK/EU markets. For Gomission, it’s a fast way to turn paused broker conversations into active pilots without adding headcount. Want me to send a 3-minute Loom that shows how it works? No pressure either way. -{{sendingAccountFirstName}}",Caitlin
