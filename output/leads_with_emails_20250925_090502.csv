I wanted to run something by you since those niche products and new partner channels often leave pockets of paused opportunities or cold leads that never convert while teams focus on onboarding and compliance with local regs. We run a database reactivation service that re-engages inactive prospects with light SMS/email follow-ups tied to product launches and partner outreach. For Gomission, it’s a way to turn those paused conversations into active accounts without hiring more headcount. Want a 3-minute Loom that shows how it works? No pressure either way. -Alex",Caitlin
