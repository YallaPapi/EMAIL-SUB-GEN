The Decisely solution provides the best combination of benefits, HR resources, and technology to support small businesses.",human resources,2015,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinjdunn,Kevin + Decisely Retirement Solutions + small businesses,"Hey Kevin — saw Decisely launch Decisely Retirement Solutions for small businesses and thought it’d be timely to reach out. With Decisely already handling E-Verify, e-docs and expanded ICHRA/voluntary benefits, I imagine you’re seeing paused retirement conversations or SMB prospects balking at setup complexity and ongoing admin. We run a database reactivation service that re-engages those inactive leads with light SMS/email follow-ups tied to product updates like your retirement rollout and compliance support. For Decisely, it’s a way to convert paused SMB talks into active clients without adding headcount. Want a 3-minute Loom that shows how it works? No pressure either way. -{{sendingAccountFirstName}}",Kevin
