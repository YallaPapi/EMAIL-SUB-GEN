I wanted to run something by you since companies using Recruiter often have stalled candidate pipelines or paused implementations when budgets, compliance (E‑Verify) or ICHRA setups get complex. We run a database reactivation service that re-engages those inactive prospects with light SMS/email tied to your product updates and compliance features. For Decisely, it’s a way to turn paused hiring conversations into active customers without adding headcount. Would you like me to send over a 3-minute Loom that shows how it works? No pressure either way. -{{sendingAccountFirstName}}",Kevin
