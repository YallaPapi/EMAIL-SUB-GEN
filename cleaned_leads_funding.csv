The need for power will only increase. We protect the grid of today while we build the grid of tomorrow.

My husband and I are active and travel often. Once our daughter was born I quickly came to the realization that traveling with an infant was extremely difficult.
One of the biggest struggles we had was our daughter refused to drink anything that was not warm. Trying to find warm water when out and about didn't seem like that difficult of a task, until we tried to. If we did find someone who could warm water up for us it would always take forever or be scalding hot from the coffee machine. When you have a crying baby time is of the essence.
So we went out on a search to find something that was small portable and battery powered so we didn't get tied down to the cord. Well after hours of searching we came to the realization that this did not exist. Frustrated we were always concerned when going out and honestly missed out on a lot of things just because we were scared we wouldn't be able to find warm water near us.
Fast forward to today, we have poured our heart and soul into The Baby's Brew. Not only does it heat water it doubles as formula storage as well. No more measuring out formula before leaving the house and no more wasting formula!
The Baby's Brew is the First Ever battery powered bottle warmer. Since every baby is different we made our bottle warmer adjust to their needs. You have the option of 3 different temperatures 98.6F, 104F, or my daughter's favorite temp 114F. You can warm up water on the go or maintain the temperature for up to 5 hours. Perfect when going on hikes or just exploring downtown.
So don't be tied down by the cord get The Baby's Brew and get out!",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alainamoulton

What is oleocanthal?

Oleocanthal is the secret ingredient you never knew you needed.
Oleocanthal is known to be responsible for the health benefits associated with olive oil. It has shown, in many studies, to have therapeutic efficacy against Alzheimer's, certain cancers, inflammatory diseases, and who knows what else!

Why do we care?

Oleolive is made up of dedicated scientists and business professionals who share a sense of responsibility and dedication to bringing about innovative advances and solutions to better people's lives.

What is the plan?

Oleocanthal is difficult to acquire and is usually of poor quality. Under our exclusive license (Thank you, University of Louisiana at Monroe!) we produce exceptional oleocanthal enabling other researchers to begin experimenting with its potential and usefulness.
Oleolive has also formulated an oleocanthal-rich supplement, Oligen, to deliver to consumers directly.
We will additionally continue to study oleocanthal's effects on Alzheimer's disease and plan to develop a commercially available treatment.

The ChildGuard hair test can detect up to 3 months of passive exposure to substances abuse, which could help support advocates seeking a safer environment.

Our History

Founder and CEO of Protein For Pets (P4P), Marco Giannini, is leaving an indelible print in the world of natural pet food and supplies while reinventing how people shop for them.

Giannini launched Protein For Pets in early 2014 and the now seven-store-strong company has locations open in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Anaheim, Rancho Cucamonga, Laguna Niguel, San Clemente and Ventura.  New locations in Valencia, Santa Clarita and Rancho San Diego are among those set to open their doors within the next few months.

But Giannini's forward-thinking commitment to enhancing the health and well-being of pets began more than a decade when he founded his first company, Dogswell in 2003.  After a modest beginning selling dog treats out of his car, Giannini went on to turn what became a national brand specializing in nutrient and supplement filled dog food and treats, from a half million dollar company within its first year to tens of millions when he sold it at the end of 2008. Giannini continued as CEO of Dogswell until leaving the company in 2013 to create Protein For Pets.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alejo-tello-ba168615b

Alex,"President, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-Founder",gsturmer@elysiumrx.com,United States,biotechnology,,"Elysium Therapeutics, Inc.",Alex Sturmer,2013.0,Denver,"Elysium's mission is to reduce suffering from severe acute pain, opioid-use disorder (OUD), and fatal opioid overdose by developing first- or best-in-class products with profiles that address the key limitations and dangers associated with opioids used today. Our pipeline consists of 3 diverse platforms with broad applicability across several areas of significant unmet need:
 
Technologies
1. O2P™ (Oral Overdose Protection) – Lead platform	Traditional opioids are easy to abuse, with euphoria and risk of respiratory depression increasing with every pill consumed.	O2P provides self-limiting exposure to active opioid and prevents overdose. 
2. XpiRx™ (Forced Expiration)	70-year half-life of traditional opioids creates a surplus supply of readily available pills that can end up on the streets.	XpiRx opioids, whose potency expires after the prescribed-use period, reduce abuse and prevent fatal overdoses.
3. SOOPR™ (Synthetic Opioid Overdose Prevention and Rescue)	Existing rescue agents are too short-acting and weak against synthetic opioids, often requiring multiple doses.	SOOPR lasts up to 24 hours and is more effective against synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl, nitazenes) than today's standard-of-care
  
Elysium has a highly attractive risk/reward profile:
 
1.       High-probability of Success: In vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept data for its new chemical entities that are comprised of FDA-approved drugs
2.       Capital Efficiency: Leveraging non-dilutive grant funding, ~$16M to-date
3.       Platform Opportunity: Diversified portfolio of programs addressing the key underlying factors that are driving the opioid crisis and could yield multiple products within 3-5 years
4.       Market: Multi-billion-dollar market potential, with weak direct pipeline competition
5.       Intellectual Property: Strong protection, with issued patents in the US and internationally, including composition of matter",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-greg-sturmer-04a7948

By joining our monthly seafood program, you'll receive a box of sustainably harvested seafood every month. We source the highest quality seafood from top Alaskan and Pacific Northwest fisheries and ship it directly to your home.

If you're like most Americans, you probably find it difficult to consistently buy premium grade seafood. Seafood fraud is running rampant in many parts of this country. In fact, a 2015 Oceana report showed that more than 40% of salmon in grocery stores and restaurants was mislabeled.

So, unless you have a trusted source, you're likely not eating what you think you are.

With the Wild Alaskan Company, our goal is to create a fully transparent sea-to-table experience, where you always:

1. Know the source of your wild-caught, sustainably harvested seafood.

2. Have direct and regular access to a variety of wild-caught species from Alaska, which we'll curate for you based on seasonality and availability.

Artem,Chief Executive Officer,artem@rhodecode.com,United States,information technology & services,2472000.0,RhodeCode,Artem Dolobanko,2013.0,Miami,"RhodeCode is an enterprise source code management platform for behind-the-firewall Mercurial, Git, and SVN. It is open source, secure, and provides centralized control over distributed code repositories. Developers get code review tools and custom APIs that work across Mercurial, Git & SVN. Companies get unified security and access controls so that their CTOs can sleep at night.

Unlike aged source code management solutions or Git-only tools, RhodeCode provides a modern platform, with unified security and tools for any version control system. The platform has been built for highly secure, behind-the-firewall enterprise environments with sophisticated user management and common authentication. Yet, it is very developer-oriented: open source, with tool integrations and powerful APIs.

*Company History*
A few years ago, a large European telecom company was undergoing a change. One of the software developers, Marcin Kuzminski, was tasked with migrating the company's code repositories from a centralized version control system to a distributed one. It quickly became evident to him that there are no tools for common authentication and security across the whole code base. Marcin started hacking instruments, and that was the beginning of RhodeCode.

Fast forward to 2016. RhodeCode is an open source platform that helps manage code of the most secure, behind-the-firewall repositories in a unified way (Mercurial, Git, and Subversion). Some of the world's largest corporate and security firms use RhodeCode.

Many children are spending time in hospitals and institutional care unnecessarily while home care is 10 times less expensive, more effective, and convenient. The pediatric home care market has not kept pace with this growing demand and is in need of thousands more nurses. 

To address the growing demand for pediatric home care, SwiftShift is reimagining pediatric home care delivery by creating the first caregiver-managed pediatric home care service. Our long-term mission is to increase the number of pediatric nurses who choose to work in this field so that every child can access reliable home care. 

Our unique offering creates more meaningful relationships between patients, families, and caregivers. We've replaced office-based case managers with nurse care teams and empowered them to manage the safe transition from the hospital to long-term home-based care. These self-managed teams choose their patients and control their schedules, creating a greater sense of ownership over their care management. 

We use an AI-based home care management platform to help our care teams focus on delivering care. No more manuals, no more paper! By providing all the relevant data in an easy-to-access interface, caregivers can make better decisions for the well-being of their patients.

Most importantly, at SwiftShift we know the best patient outcomes start and end with the best nursing experience. That's why we are committed to our caregivers' professional development by providing 24/7 training and support services.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/assafshalvi

It's not just a motto. It's Antidote's purpose, our business model – and our ethos.

Why? In the U.S. alone, more than 82 million people don't have adequate health insurance.

That is an injustice. It is bad for the economy. And it is morally indefensible.
We strive to attain a world in which every human being has access to affordable quality healthcare, no matter their race, location, or circumstance. Access to affordable healthcare means more than being able to see a doctor when you're sick. It means being able to live your life fully, without unnecessary barriers and fear. In fact, we steadfastly believe that quality everyday healthcare is a basic human right.

This world we're trying to achieve is one in which we all look out for each other, and no one gets left behind.

That is why we created Antidote Health. Our services are designed for everyone, regardless of their current health status or financial resources, and are based on a simple premise: the cost of healthcare can be reduced by making people healthier and keeping them that way.

We are revolutionizing the way healthcare is paid for and delivered, putting most of the services patients need under one roof, making them affordable and simplifying the entire process. We take care of our patients' health and quality of life, inspired by the most fundamental element of society: the community.

No community is truly healthy if one of its members is sick. And whenever one of its members flourishes, the entire community does. We're all in this together.

And we all deserve good healthcare. All of us. Everyone. We're working to create a better world, in which no one is left behind.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/avihaisoudri

Ayla,CEO/President InvivoSciences Inc. TedX Speaker for Invivosciences Inc.,aannac@invivosciences.com,United States,research,17712000.0,InvivoSciences® Inc.,Ayla Annac,2001.0,McFarland,"the InvivoSciences'​ mission is the research and development of engineered tissue-based assays that are superior because they mimic the functions of living organisms, specifically, those of animals and humans. Designed to meet the increasing demand for efficacy and productivity in the areas of drug discovery and life sciences research, we provide automated, real-time, high-content and highly sensitive detection systems that are as predictive and cost effective as they are revolutionary. 

Most current in vitro drug testing methods use two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures that do not take into account the impact of the physical environment in which cells grow. This results in unsatisfactory, sometimes misleading and non-predictive data for in vivo responses.  The ready-to-use tissues and assay platforms produced by InvivoSciences provide three-dimensional (3D) geometrics and physical environments for cells, bridging the gap between cell-based systems and isolated organ tissue systems or animal models, and can therefore act as model systems for chemical screening assays. This provides researchers with screening strategies that can assess the potential toxicity of new drugs--including those for cardiac applications--in accurate, predictive detection environments requiring less time and cost than corresponding studies using animals. 
 
On Mar 24-25, 2009, InvivoSciences presented its technology and business model at the World's Best Technology showcase in Texas. InvivoSciences was among the top 3 award winners at the showcase. The company was selected by investors, licensees, and tech-commercialization experts to receive the ""gold""​ award.

Flag & Anthem exemplifies a refined to rugged look with an authentic, vintage-inspired aesthetic and specializes in making comfortable and versatile clothing that you can wear while you enjoy your everyday life, wherever it takes you. Seasonal collections include casual button-downs, elevated knitwear, classic denim and jeans with stretch, signature chinos, hybrid shorts, and much more.

As Flag & Anthem continues to grow, we have begun to branch out into other categories. In fall 2020 we expanded our women's collection from flannel shirts to also include super-soft sweaters, dresses, skirts and stretch denim jeans.

In Spring 2018, Flag & Anthem started a long-term partnership with country music star Dierks Bentley on the brand's Desert Son product line. 

In addition to our collaboration with Dierks Bentley, we have also established long-term partnerships with San Francisco 49er's All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey and NASCAR  Champion driver Ryan Blaney.

In Spring 2024 Flag & Anthem announced their newest brand ambassador and first professional golfer, Keegan Bradley, ranked 16th in Official World Golf Rankings. Bradley started wearing the new Flag & Anthem performance golf product and signature brand logo on his chest beginning 2024 during all tour events.

As we continue to grow, we have continued to look for ways to give back to our community and one way we have done so is by teaming up with our ambassadors to create exclusive charity tees and donating 100% of proceeds to organizations important to us all.

The products we develop will treat obesity and diabetes by shrinking fat cell size and by preventing compromised metabolism in enlarged cells.

Businesses can now run their own marketing promotions both within their venues and outside of them by utilizing Atmosphere Ads, and keep the content fresh with custom playlists!

In doing so, we work closely with the private sector, governments, agriculture and health implementers, mobile network operators and value-added service providers, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to prime our solutions for adoption and scale.

Wish recipents must also have a history of giving back to their community and an annual income of less than 200% of poverty level. 

Wishes granted range from simple basic needs wishes such as eyeglasses or a lift chair to more elaborate lifelong wishes such as meeting a favorite baseball player or a ride in a fighter jet.

The company is most focused on Creatv Bio Division, and its mission is to dramatically reduce global cancer mortality.

Our innovative LifeTracDx® blood test can detect cancer in the earliest stages before symptoms. It can also confirm whether a patient is responding to treatment and surveils for early signs of recurrence after treatment has finished. Creatv Bio also developed a wide spectrum of cancer diagnostics to improve patient care. Clinical application of this highly sensitive and specific test will improve cancer treatment outcomes.
 
Cancer touches all of us. Almost 40% of Americans develop cancer in their lifetime. Over half of these diagnoses occur after significant progression, in stages 3 and 4, making it difficult to achieve successful therapeutic outcomes. Early detection with high accuracy is needed for all major cancers. 

Nearly 18 million Americans are living with a history of cancer, many in remission under surveillance for possible recurrence. Early detection of recurrence enables faster response and improved outcomes. 

LifeTracDx® liquid biopsy platform uncovered a previously unknown cell in the blood of cancer patients, the cancer associated macrophage-like cell (CAML). These cells are very large and distinctly different from normal cells and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CAMLs are found in patients with cancer, but not in healthy individuals. CAMLs are highly informative, because they contain markers of the cancer type and indicate sensitivity or resistance to particular treatments. Unlike CTCs, CAMLs are found in all stages of cancer, including stage I. 

Together, CAMLs and CTCs provide a unique capability for early detection of cancer, monitoring treatment, and watching for recurrence. LifeTracDx® will be available in a CLIA lab by the beginning of the second quarter of 2025.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/cha-mei-tang-70670424b

(MSI) is a medical technology company working to transform the cardiac and cancer care continuum. Leveraging more than 400 publications in clinical research and development, MSI's proprietary technology, MyoStrain®, is a 10-minute, non-invasive heart function test providing physicians with sensitive diagnostic markers to support the early assessment and individualized treatment of heart dysfunction. 

This novel cardiac tool leverages the power of high-speed MR imaging to help physicians detect and measure the effects of cardiotoxicity during cancer treatments. Physicians are using MyoStrain as a critical solution to holistically evaluate and protect patient heart health without interfering with oncology care. 

Today, with mounting evidence that many oncology treatments cause cardiotoxicity, new cancer patients and survivors are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, diagnostics often cannot detect cardiotoxicity until symptoms occur, which is usually a sign of cardiac damage. 

The MyoStrain test works by quantifying segmental strain across 48 segments of the heart. This safe and rapid test produces a comprehensive report and MyoHealth™ Score, a single number that helps indicate patient heart health and enables physicians to manage cardio-protection over time.

MyoStrain has received FDA-510(k) pre-market clearance, CE-mark certification, and is commercially available in the United States and Europe.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/clete-madden-b0857b10

Our mission is to build the workforce of highly trained caregivers that many Californians can't live without. We will champion training for all caregivers and make it universally accessible. We believe that trained caregivers will be respected and valued professionals who have been proven to enhance the quality of life and save money for our overburdened healthcare system. Our efforts will create jobs and upward mobility for the millions of people who are needed as caregivers in California. With the wave of the baby boomers in or approaching retirement age, 10,000 people will turn 65 every day for the next 15 years, which creates systemic pressures and the need for growth of the long-term care workforce.

""You don't know what better is until you actually experience it,"" he recalls, and was then determined to offer back-to-basics eating all across America.

Chef and restaurateur Brian Bennett shared Paul's vision. Over dinner one evening, both men celebrated the flavor of clean, ""real food"" ingredients, but lamented how most Americans don't know where their food comes from and have difficulty accessing higher-quality ingredients.

Thus began their quest to change America's food story.

Paul and Brian knew this story must start at the source. They traveled to and partnered with renowned vineyards for exclusive wines, California cattle ranchers for humanely raised beef, and calamari fishermen in Rhode Island for sustainably harvested seafood. Their Never-Settle Sourcing philosophy meant collaborating with the most conscientious and talented farmers and purveyors they could find. And just like that, a new restaurant concept was born.

Paul Martin's American Grill is on a mission to make the food America loves set to a higher standard—always without hormones or antibiotics—and all served in an environment of convivial and remarkable hospitality. We warmly invite you to enjoy America's New Food Story.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelio-ximil-886705101

Last year, CMOM served more than 350,000 people, which included 65,000 children who visited the Museum as part of a school group or through one of the Museum's off-site partners. CMOM is committed to making its exhibits and programs available to all, and with nearly 50 sites around New York City, we continually reach thousands of families who might not otherwise be able to benefit from our services.

CMOM's four priority areas are meant to impact children in ways that will last a lifetime: early childhood education prepares children to enter kindergarten; creativity in the arts and sciences inspires creative and analytical thinking skills for lifelong learning; healthy lifestyles programs provide a blueprint for a family's physical, emotional and environmental well being; and the exploration of world cultures gives children awareness, understanding and context for the diverse society they are part of. These priorities are met through exhibitions, classes, workshops, performances and Museum-sponsored festivals.

CMOM's programs and exhibits are designed to address the multiple ways children learn and to help parents understand and support their children's development.

OUR ROOTS
We were born from the compassionate vision and dream of Senator James Couzens. Following the great stock market crash of 1929, record numbers of children were abandoned, suffering hopelessly with a seemingly bleak future.

James Couzens chose not to look away, but to look deeper. He inspired other leaders to do the same. Those who saw children not as they were, but for what they could become.

Almost a century later, James Couzens' vision has become a movement shared by many who are joined in a common resolve. A resolve to make life work for children, so they may grow into the amazing people they were born to be, regardless of their circumstances, mental health, or behavioral challenges.

Here's to the possibility that life can not only work for children — but that children can dream again.

BRAND PROMISE
Helping children dream again.

MISSION
We put children and families at the center of all we do. We strive to help them shape their own futures, and carve out a path that's brighter than even they imagine.

BELIEFS
• We believe in treating and healing the whole child and family.
• We believe in advancing care through the use of evidence-based treatments.
• We believe in respecting our children's struggles and advocating for their rights.
• And most of all, we believe in building bigger dreams and brighter futures.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/desiree-jennings-28951a1b

Det,Chief Executive Officer,det@neuralerttechnologies.com,United States,hospital & health care,1500000.0,Neuralert Technologies,Det Ansinn,2019.0,Doylestown,"Stroke is the #1 cause of long-term disability, one in four people living today over the age of 25 will have a stroke in their lifetime, and 10% of all strokes happen to patients already in the hospital for other reasons. Time consuming, manual stroke detection means a majority of in-hospital strokes aren't detected or treated for over 4.5 hours resulting in poor outcomes, increased cost and liability, and even patient death.
Neuralert automates stroke detection using non-invasive wristbands that continuously monitor patient arm asymmetry, a classic indication of stroke. The bands transmit telemetry to a patented algorithm, developed by the University of Pennsylvania, which analyzes the data for stroke symptoms. The algorithm also eliminates asymmetry caused by other factors (e.g., hand dominance, eating, an IV in the arm) resulting in an extremely low false alarm rate. When stroke asymmetry is detected, the system immediately alerts staff so they can assess the patient and speed treatment. 
The automated Neuralert stroke monitoring system has been proven to detect stroke symptoms five times faster than the current standard of care. Faster stroke detection will save lives, improve outcomes, reduce cost and litigation, and ensure patients are not forced to face a potential lifetime of disability and loss of independence.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/detansinn

ThirdAI (pronunciation:  /THərd ī/ Third eye) is a cutting-edge Artificial intelligence startup carving scalable and sustainable AI. 

UNIQUE APPROACH- ThirdAI accelerator builds hash-based processing algorithms for training and inference with neural networks. The technology is a result of 10 years of innovation in finding efficient (beyond tensor) mathematics for deep learning.  

Our algorithmic innovation has demonstrated how we can make Commodity x86 CPUs 15x or faster than most potent NVIDIA GPUs for training large neural networks.

The demonstration has shaken the common knowledge prevailing in the AI community that specialized processors like GPUs are significantly superior to CPUs for training neural networks.

Several media outlets echo our technological superiority: 

IEEE Spectrum describes, ""What they report is stunning."" Investorplace considers the algorithm one of the biggest threats to NVIDIA Stock (a $500  billion company). 

Engadget calls it a ""Completely different approach to Deep Learning"". 

A quote from WCCFTech says, ""If an implementation of this algorithm is mainstreamed it would almost instantly disrupt the dynamics of the deep learning ecosystem. Valuations of companies could change overnight.""

Our innovation would not only benefit current AI training by shifting to lower-cost CPUs, but it should also allow the ""unlocking"" of AI training workloads on GPUs that were not previously feasible.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanrajp

Dolores,Chief Executive Officer,dolores.schroeder@raicestexas.org,United States,legal services,1318000.0,RAICES,Dolores Schroeder,1986.0,,"RAICES, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization formally known as the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, was created in 1986 to welcome and fight for families seeking safety and freedom in the U.S. 

We started as a two-person team in a tiny San Antonio office and kept growing to include Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and Laredo — and to make our services accessible to people in rural communities statewide. Today, with our Texas roots and national reach, we advocate for the rights and prosperity of all our families, neighbors, and community members. 

We grew from the Sanctuary Movement as a response to immigration policies that created impossible legal barriers for Central American refugees to seek protection in the U.S. In a time of exceptional need, our neighbors across the country came together and showed us what it means to be a more welcoming nation. 

Originally a grassroots community-based organization known as the Refugee Aid Project, RAICES was accredited by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as a legal services provider in 1993 — centering our advocacy for access to representation as critical to equitable outcomes in immigration court — and expanded further in 2017 to include refugee resettlement services in collaboration with our national partner, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI).  

We believe in a country where everyone has access to legal and social services — no matter where you come from. A place where people don't have to go to court to face a giant institution on their own. A place where people don't have to navigate a maze of local, state, and federal bureaucracies created to keep them out — because we know that our services keep families together and free.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/doloresschroeder

However, there are only 15 thousand publicly available EV chargers, and that number is not seeing nearly the same growth. The reasons for this deficit are 1) the high cost of infrastructure and installation, and 2) the minimal returns of managing chargers. TEQ Charging, or The Electric Queue is here to change that. First, with our cloud-based power management platform, we give much less expensive ‘dumb' chargers smart functionality. Second, we allow more cars to plug in than there is available power to serve, queuing the power from one car to the next throughout the day, optimized based on requested departure time. This results in a 4-6x increase in the number of cars charged per day without having to pay potentially hundreds of thousands to expand panel space. For the drivers, this means no more missed events because the person in front of them didn't move their car on time.

Most clinical interventions happen alongside a patient, and devices using existing software, such as PCs, tablets, or smartphones, are impractical due to potential hand contamination, the inconvenience of being out of reach, out of view, interruption, and distraction. Clinicians should be able to contemporaneously validate clinical procedures, without having to manipulate a computing device. 

Clear Protocol® AI was specially designed to validate clinical procedures, hands-free, in a practical way. A solution such as Clear Protocol® AI ""…has the ability to significantly impact improvements in quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care.""

Third parties play an instrumental role in today's business environment, and sensitive data is shared amongst companies that are part of their ecosystems. 
Compliance requirements hold organizations liable for any data breaches involving companies that ""touch"" their data, which means steep fines and potential business disruptions. Massive cloud adoption further complicates the scenario because securing the cloud is more difficult than in other environments and skilled personnel is scarce. The current methods and tools used by companies to manage their third-party risk make the process very confrontational, yet shallow and without visibility into cloud environments. Tenchi's product was developed from scratch to be based on cooperation, with a controlled sharing of security postures and maturity data between organizations that is beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Large enterprises can finally have the visibility they need to ensure that their data is properly secured whether it is in their own environments or in a third party's. Third parties gain much-needed help to improve their security postures through an automated process that greatly reduces the burdens they face dealing with endless questionnaires and audits. Plus, the product reduces information asymmetry in the ecosystem, so market forces can work to reward security-conscious third parties with more business from regulated corporate customers and higher margins.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-boucas-77754b2

The ability to directly measure the combustion process enables the process to be optimized. For coal-fired power plants this means improved efficiency, increased reliability, and reduced emissions of NOx and CO2, the leading cause of climate change. The United States consumes more than 1,000,000,000 tons of coal every year, thus even small efficiency improvements can have a significant impact. For instance, improving the efficiency of the US coal-fired fleet by an average of just 2%, a goal attainable using Zolo Technologies' sensor technology, is equivalent to:

Reducing CO2 emissions by 43,000,000 tons
Removing 8,000,000 cars from the roads
Creating 5,000,000 CO2-free households
Installing 30,000 large wind turbines

Parking Sucks - we know. We may not be able to solve it entirely but we can take away a lot of the stress. Everyday, people leave their garages and driveways to go to work, on vacation, or visit a friend. They leave their parking spot barren. Empty. Unused. Then, at night when business wraps up and everyone is enjoying Happy Hour or heads home, their designated work spots sit vacant. With all of the frustrated people scouring the cities for spots, why are there so many empty spaces that no one can use?!

Pied Parker is the solution - keep the streets from being overrun with frustrated, parking-hungry people, and keep empty parking spots from being left lonely and desolate. Pied Parker connects the people anxiously searching for parking with the unused parking spots left by their owners, whether for a few hours, a day or a week. From driveway spots to assigned apartment or office spots, there is bound to be a vacant spot for each parking-craving driver. We just help them find each other. No more having to explain to your boss, friends, or clients why you are running 20 minutes late, and how have coffee conveniently spilled down the front of your shirt. No more friends chuckling at you from their apartment window as you circle the block for the third time. No more nausea from the incessant turns of the parking garage ramps.

Pied Parker takes the hassle out of parking, so you can focus on the things that really matter.

This longstanding issue has caused inefficiencies, delays, and costly errors, burdening providers and suppliers alike. Beyond being a frustration, it represents a systemic problem with significant financial and operational consequences for the entire healthcare ecosystem.

Recognizing this, Helia set out to develop a solution tailored to the complexity of modern healthcare.

Suppliers are seeing significant reductions in days sales outstanding, improved cash flow, and streamlined operational efficiency.

Looking ahead, Helia is committed to delivering even greater value across our network. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, we're making data interactions faster and smarter. We're delivering the industry's fastest end-to-end case-to-invoice transactions—processing in as little as 60 seconds—and we're introducing advanced case scheduling features that enable providers and suppliers across our network to make real-time, data-driven decisions.

Henria,Owner,drfain@hmfmd.com,United States,hospital & health care,,DoctorDoctor,Henria Fain,1969.0,Tampa,"DoctorDoctor is an after-hours medical service provider. Formerly known as the Australian Locum Medical Service (ALMS), the company has been providing in-home, after hours care to patients of GPs for nearly half a century. It was the first service of its kind in Melbourne and Perth. Our services are now available in Brisbane and Sydney as well.  

In 2016 ALMS was restructured as DoctorDoctor. The purpose was to deliver our vision of connected care – accessible and affordable after hours care, complementing the services of the daytime GP. This coordinated and collaborative relationship results in the best outcome for patients who get a high quality, seamless experience. 

We believe that GPs can provide their patients with the best medical care. However, sometimes patients need medical care after hours. This is where DoctorDoctor can help. Our qualified and experienced staff will triage calls from patients and send the details to our doctors in the field. Our doctor will then call prior to arrival, treat patients in their home and keep their GP informed with a detailed report. The next day, the daytime GP can take over confident that the patient was well cared for in their absence. That's connected care. 

Our medical services are bulk billed for patients with Medicare or Veterans Affairs.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/henria-fain-md-dpt-atc-a75658a8

The sweet spot applications are in formulation, catalysis, and synthesis for the pharma, biotech, food, chemicals, energy, and climate tech industries. Atinary is committed to addressing global challenges and inspiring a future where science and innovation improve exponentially.

The name Atinary comes from the verb in Spanish ""atinar"", which means hit, as in hit the target. Atinary's leading ML technology optimizes experimental planning, orchestrates workflows, and hit targets 10 to 100 times faster, in weeks or months, instead of years. 

Accelerating R&D matters because materials are essential to improve our lives and tackle some of humanity's biggest challenges. For example, better materials are key to reduce pollution and address climate change, and to improve health. We need better materials to develop a) more affordable batteries that last longer and are not toxic; b) more efficient solar cells that can be deployed everywhere; and c) more effective carbon capture, use and sequestration tech. Similarly, to discover new medicines and vaccines, we need to find the optimal conditions to hit the right molecules.

This is especially meaningful now, when many teams and departments are split across multiple locations and companies are embracing remote or hybrid work models. People aren't getting that valuable opportunity to touch base, bond, and get to know each other better – which means companies are suffering from poor teamwork and a deteriorating workplace culture.

But where can you find a teambuilding activity that actually walks the walk and gets those results, instead of leaving everyone more stressed and divided than they were before? That's where we come in, with diverse customizable programs that are being used by over 1,500 companies worldwide, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay, Oracle, and more.

Whether it was tending to her 800 sq. ft greenhouse or formulating plant- derived beauty products for her friends and family, it was in her DNA to believe that the best ingredients come from the earth. So, you can imagine her surprise when doctors diagnosed her with a life-threatening brain tumor that they believed could be environmentally derived.

It didn't take long for a re-invigorated and healed Indie to embrace radical self-acceptance, a commitment to joy, and a never-ending pursuit for plant and people-first solutions. Then it happened, Indie created Indie.
Captivated by her resilient spirit and capacity to touch others through her mission, Indie enlisted the best of the best the industry had to offer. Partnering with world-class formulators and like-minded investors, Indie's vision was made a reality. Her quest to source the earth's finest ingredients fuels her line of high-performing, versatile, beauty products that lives up to the highest standards of clean and cruelty-free as seen with our numerous certifications, including COSMOS and Leaping Bunny.

Her commitment to bringing products grounded in nature, supported through science, and inspired by life to everyone is reinforced daily by her spirit and the support of those who believe wholeheartedly in her calling to infuse the beauty industry with authenticity and efficacy. Indie's transformative mission transcends beauty; she has spoken at events such as SXSW and PopSugar Play/ Ground. She also serves on the FIDM Beauty Program's Advisory Council and sits on the board of the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association. It is Indie's sincere hope that her awakening creates change and inspires others to live life passionately and with purpose.

With the 911inform platform, it runs parallel on the NG911 network to dispatch centers pinpointing the location of the emergency call. Instant notifications are sent to all parties in a 911inform geofenced building attached to a detailed floor plan. We get the first responders to you faster. Saving time, and possibly a life.

The optical system consists of LetinAR's self-developed ""Pin Mirror (""PinMR™"") lens"" and a microdisplay made by external partners.
Current smartglasses manufacturers use traditional optical systems such as Half-mirror, Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs), and waveguides to build the devices. Under-par performance of those optical systems has hardly satisfied users and experts. The bulky body, narrow Field of View (FOV), complicated manufacturing process, and inaccurate color expression have long been a stumbling block for successful commercialization of AR smart glasses. 
LetinAR PinMR™"" lens is set to replace such displays. The company has applied the so-called ""Pinhole Effect"" to tiny mirrors and embedded them with eyeglass lenses. Respective PinMR™ reflects the light from a microdisplay and guides the light into human pupils. Users may view the virtual image from the microdisplay as well as the image from the real world at ease. Human eyes cannot detect the mirrors because the mirrors are smaller than human pupils. Only the virtual image formed by the light reflected by those mirrors becomes visual. 
With LetinAR PinMR™ lens, manufacturers can build smartglasses worn like a pair of conventional glasses. The simple structure of PinMR™ Lens module can facilitate mass production. PinMR™ Lens shows wider virtual screen than the currently available optical systems while more accurately expressing colors – an edge over diffraction-based or refraction-based systems from competitors. PinMR™ Lens can also show a clear image without inducing dizziness because it is able to extend the Depth of Field (DOF) multiple times.

We work super-hard to design, source, produce, offer, and deliver what we think are the greatest products on the planet. 

Ann and I have always loved finding and making great things to share with people – in short, making a connection with everyone. We've had this itch since we were young, making mix tapes and organizing parties. Together, we opened a single shop on the west side of Atlanta in 2007... and then we kept going. 

Because you don't need a lot of choices... you just need the right choices.

We'd had this sort of mental, analog Pinterest board brewing since we met, of all the things we loved and wanted to put together in one place. So when we began, we knew it wasn't only about making cool, special, useful things. It was about the curating of them, making the selection a little less daunting, a little easier, even fun. 

SID and ANN shops opened in Houston in winter 2013, Georgetown, Washington, D.C. and Dallas, in fall 2015. In fall 2016 a Sid Mashburn-only men's shop opened in the Brentwood Country Mart in LA, and during winter 2022 the NYC SID and ANN shop opened on the Upper East Side in Manhattan.

In addition to the retail locations, the e-commerce shop at www.shopmashburn.com serves customers from all over the world. 

Ours is a simple concept: a combination of our own designed-and-produced clothing (shirting, trousers, footwear, accessories, made-to-measure tailored clothing) and our favorite classic, iconic, and hard-to-find pieces... all in a space designed to feel as beautiful, inspiring, and welcoming as possible. Our role is not only to offer great things, but to provide over-the-top service: whether it's making sure your things fit perfectly, recommending a record, or making a dinner reservation, we are here to make it happen.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-cho-371a3

Ophirex is developing a ""time of bite"" oral snakebite treatment that blocks the most commonly lethal component of snake venom—present in 95% of the world's venomous snakes.[4] This antidote—now in human clinical trials—can be administered immediately in the field or in the hospital to effectively stop the venom's devastating assault.[5][6][7]

As a former Vogue editor, Moda co-founder Lauren Santo Domingo noticed a disconnect between the bold, expressive fashion from the runways and what she saw in stores. Then, she saw an opportunity. 

Today, it is our mission to make it easy for fashion designers to grow their business and consumers to realize their personal style. Moda is the only place in the world where fashion designers can sell their most creative work, including less commercial and one-of-a-kind pieces to a global audience of fashion-engaged consumers who want to shop them.

The Moda Operandi platform carries hundreds of brands and designers across women's, men's, fine jewelry, and home. Moda has over 400 employees globally, ships to 125 countries, and has raised nearly $300 million in funding from top-tier investors.

By using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and our proprietary enabling technologies, Day Zero is creating a new class of sequencing-based in-vitro diagnostics that generates clinically actionable data at scale. Our technologies include novel sample preparation methods enabling unprecedented ultra-high enrichment of pathogen DNA for sequencing directly from clinical samples, machine learning algorithms that provide clinically actionable diagnostic results, and a world-class database of WGS and drug efficacy profiles. Day Zero Diagnostics is on a mission to transform the way infectious disease diagnostics are performed by generating the stream of real-time sequencing data required to change how we track, manage and combat infectious diseases.

With an enormous unmet clinical and economic need, we are targeting bloodstream infections and sepsis for our first application. The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to ""carpet bomb"" patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Day Zero delivers a complete diagnosis, including both the species and antibiotic resistance profile, in hours vs. days, enabling the physician to use a targeted treatment on day zero of hospital admission and resulting in better patient outcomes and cost savings.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonghlee

PAD is the narrowing or blockage of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the legs or lower extremities; it is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis. PAD can happen in any blood vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms. It affects 200 million people globally. Approximately 6.5 million people at the age of 40 and older in the United States have PAD. These numbers continue to rise given the increasing burden of risk factors and an aging population. If a patient has PAD, they are at risk for developing coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke as well.
The R3 Vascular BVS platform combines the best of both worlds of BTK therapy, designed to deliver the ‘stent-like' support of a scaffold, along with the anti-inflammatory result of sirolimus, but ‘disappearing' over time as the vessel heals. R3 Vascular is headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., USA, with additional operations in Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kamal-ramzipoor-71754b177

Kathleen,Chief Executive Officer,glaub@curasen.com,United States,research,6500000.0,"CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc.",Kathleen Glaub,2017.0,Berkeley,"It's time to think again about therapies for neurodegenerative disease. At CuraSen, we are targeting neurodegeneration with novel science and treatments so patients can THINK, AGAIN.

CuraSen Therapeutics, Inc. is a privately funded biopharmaceutical company pursuing development of novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as several orphan indications. Millions of patients and their families are burdened by these diseases, and the numbers continue to grow annually with the aging population.

At CuraSen, we are rethinking the therapeutic approach to treatment of neurodegenerative diseases—and advancing a concept based on restoring a key functionality to a pathway lost early in the degenerating brain. This pathway emanates from the locus coeruleus (LC), site of the earliest pathology seen in these diseases – perhaps the ‘hypocenter' of neurodegeneration.

We began clinical testing of our hypothesis in 2019 using established drugs from other therapeutic areas, which has informed our development program and helped advance our first new chemical entity, CST-2032, to the clinic in September 2020.  

CuraSen has assembled an impressive team, deeply experienced in the neuroscience, pharmacology and clinical development core to its approach, as well as top tier investor backing, including New Leaf Venture Partners, Longitude Capital, funds managed by Tekla Capital Management LLC, Alta Partners, Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc.

1.	Sustaining a commitment to core classical programming distinguished by intelligent curation, brilliant performance, and innovative delivery through four annual series.

2.	Showcasing the Mainly Mozart Festival Orchestra, the nation's largest assemblage of concertmasters and principal players from North America's leading orchestras, performing under the baton of Maestro Michael Francis.

We have developed a first-of-its-kind low light energy harvesting photovoltaic (PV) technology that generates more than three times the power of conventional indoor PV technologies from a broader spectrum of indoor and outdoor ambient light. This chemistry breakthrough enables revolutionary advances in device design, function, performance, sustainability, reliability and consumer experience. 

Unlike high performance solar photovoltaic technologies of the past, these innovations are cost compatible with today's mass scale technologies. Ambient employs a novel industrial solar printing technology to coat its proprietary chemistry on thin, durable glass substrates -- producing photovoltaic cells of virtually any size and shape. This flexibility empowers industrial designers, allowing them to embed Ambient's cells into a variety of product shapes and structures.

Ambient enhances manufacturers' opportunities to align with consumer values that further boost sales and brand loyalty. In an era in which consumers value both cutting-edge connected technology and planet-friendly products, Ambient empowers brands to deliver both. By eliminating battery waste and harvesting energy from everyday light, Ambient's PV cells reduce the carbon footprint of average IoT devices by an estimated 77 percent. The company's ambient light-harvested power source also solves the ubiquitous customer pain point of battery life, delivering a maintenance-hassle-free and reliable ownership experience.

Ambient is inspiring a new era in connected device form and function -- delivering superior energy density and performance through a solar cell that advances industrial design and production at scale at a price point that makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kethinni-chittibabu-1489567

Today, Nevco scoreboards, message centers and video displays are used to enhance the fan experience at events worldwide.

The Company derived its name from its founder, Ralph Nevinger. Nevco is known to be the largest privately held scoreboard manufacturer in the world. The Company is headed by G. D. Moore.

The first scoreboard model, manufactured in 1934, consisted of a white oak cabinet with a glass dial clock and glass disks for the scores. Since that time, Nevco has been a leader in the transformation of the scoring and display industry.

Scoreboard technology has advanced from the use of electric motors to solid state electronics; from incandescent bulb models to LED technology; and from hard wired control systems to the use of wireless controls.

The introduction of LED message centers and video displays has provided our Customers additional ways to involve and excite the fans and generate significant sponsorship revenue.

With a commitment to quality, customer service and product innovation, the goal of the Nevco Team is to exceed the needs of our Customers. Our worldwide sales force stands ready to provide a customized solution for your facility.

Now more than ever, businesses need to think about digital transformation and automation. 

Solvoyo is the true enabler of digital transformation. Our cloud based SaaS platform uses advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to optimize and automate decision making in supply chain planning. 

Our all-in-one platform forecasts demand, optimizes inventory, plans production, replenishes networks and concurrently optimizes fulfillment and transportation plans; eliminating silos while reducing the dependency on manual work.

The District Alliance for Safe Housing (DASH) is an innovator in providing access to safe housing and services for survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their families as they rebuild their lives on their own terms. 

HISTORY:
In 2006, DASH was founded at a time when there were less than 50 beds in the District dedicated specifically for victims of domestic violence. Survivors with multiple barriers including mental health and addiction issues had even fewer options for safe housing. Unlike the various housing programs in the city, the vision for DASH has been to create a culture where safe housing is a right shared by everyone.

Since 2006, DASH has grown to become the city's largest dedicated safe housing provider for survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their children.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/koube-ngaaje-50956023

Vic.ai addresses the most manual and inefficient task in accounting – invoice processing – to improve its speed and scalability, and ultimately enable customers to reinvent their accounts payable operations and improve financial management. 

Accounting tasks have always been managed using legacy systems that are based on predefined, fragile rules and templates. It's mundane, inefficient, and error-prone work. Vic.ai throws the need for rules and templates out the window.

Accounting tasks work autonomously with the Vic.ai platform to minimize the human input and interpretation that legacy, rules-based systems require. Vic.ai's accounts payable solution uses advanced AI, which gets smarter the more invoices it ingests, and autonomous workflows to automatically process error-free invoices, allowing the team to focus on more important matters than manual data entry.

Vic.ai works with finance professionals to give them the tools they need to make everyday operations simpler and more intelligent. From processing invoices to data predictions, the Vic.ai intelligent and autonomous solution gives companies the bandwidth needed to complete higher value tasks often pushed aside in the day-to-day.

By processing more than half a billion invoices with up to 99% accuracy, Vic.ai has helped 10,000+ customers achieve nearly $188 million in cost savings and 6 million hours in time savings.

We are a public-private partnership established to drive the next phase of growth for the region – innovation that will be enabled and delivered by startups.

Why do we do this?

A tech-focused economy is a self-sustaining ecosystem that continuously attracts talent, creates jobs and investment opportunities, which eventually leads to one solution, that leads to the next, and then the next.

Greater Cincinnati is primed for this, as we are the home of hundreds of global corporations who depend on innovation to solve their biggest problems, yet, are often too large to be agile.

This may be unlike our tech-based startups who have talent and agility, but often lack the funding to see their solutions through or, if they do, the ability to reach potential customers.

Not to mention, Cincinnati has several Universities with valuable knowledge and research at their fingertips.

All of these entities are all close, but seldom, if ever, collaborating. And with investors waiting to invest wisely across the country, we have all the makings for a thriving tech-based economy – just waiting for something to help set it into motion.

Kym,Castle Manager,kym@muncaster.co.uk,United States,hospitality,217000.0,Muncaster Castle & Pennington Hotels Group,Kym Armstrong,,Raleigh,"A Family owned and run historic Castle on the western coast of the Lake District, with a group of hotel's and establishments throughout.

Comprising of 3 hotels and a historic Inn we pride ourselves on great food and atmosphere for any occasion.

This family derive their pedigree from Gamel de Pennington, who was a very considerable person, before and at the conquest as appears by several ancient rolls, registers, and records; from whom, the present Sir Joseph Pennington, is derived, in a lineal descent of numerous ancestors of note"" so quotes the author of ""The English Baronetage"" published in 1741.

While there are numerous Gamels in Pennington history so it becomes difficult to know to which the above might refer, if the author of the ""English Baronetage"" is correct then the Penningtons were an important family in Cumberland before the Norman Conquest of 1066.

Tracing the early family tree is difficult as few documents survive from this period, further complicated by reuse of popular family names Benedict and Gamel, together with John, Joseph and William in later generation. Gamel even makes a fairly recent reappearance with the 4th Lord Muncaster, born in 1831.

The Pennington family have recorded evidence of Muncaster being their home since 1208, when the lands were granted to Alan de Penitone although some records suggest that the family were at Muncaster back as far as 1026.

In 1464 Sir John Pennington gave shelter to Henry VI, wandering after the Battle of Hexham. Many years later in 1783, John, Lord Muncaster erected the tower known as Chapels to commemorate the place where the fugitive King was supposed to have been found by the shepherds. The legend tells how Holy King Harry on his departure left his drinking bowl behind in gratitude, saying that as long as it should remain quite whole and unbroken the Penningtons would live and thrive in the place. Today the Venetian glass bowl is still intact and is known as the ‘Luck of Muncaster'.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the family married well and in 1783 when there was a vacancy in the Irish Peerage, the fifth Baronet was created first Baron Muncaster. He was a friend of Pitt and long a Member of Parliament. He carried out extensive works at Muncaster, including planting most of the large hardwood trees, and it was he who started the present library. He was succeeded by his brother, General Lowther Pennington, who in his youth was a hot head. While serving in America he killed a man in a duel called for a ""foolish quarrel about humming a tune"".

Shortly before his death in 1862, his grandson Gamel Augustus, fourth Lord Muncaster, instructed Anthony Salvin the famous architect to renovate the house, giving us the castle largely as we know it today.

In 1917 Gamel's brother, the fifth and last Lord Muncaster, died without children and the estate reverted to his nearest relation on his mother's side, Sir John Ramsden, on condition that his second son changed his name from Ramsden to Pennington. A notable family in their own right, the Ramsdens had played a significant part in the history of Yorkshire, as well as owning other estates. It was Sir John who started planting rhododendron seedlings at Muncaster from his other great garden at Bulstrode, Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire, a Somerset family estate which he inherited through his mother.  Sir John was the great grandfather of the Castle's current owner Iona Frost Pennington.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/kym-armstrong-b24a8733a

67% of American women wear sizes 14+—that's 100 million women. Yet this majority is systematically underserved by the retail industry. The plus size community faces paltry options, unwelcoming environments, and a lack of representation—all adding up to a disappointing experience with style.

Our Vision:
Style freedom through a life well-lived

The Dia & Co Solution:
Dia & Co is the only retail service dedicated to meeting the plus size community's full range of style needs. We're applying the best of data and technology to serve women who have been ignored for far too long—from developing the shopping experiences she's always wanted, to building community platforms that inspire her, to ensuring she sees herself represented in the world around her.

Our Approach — Representative Retail:
Dia & Co is a company built around a customer, not a business model. Our community leads the way, and we meet their unique needs by creating products and experiences across three comprehensive areas of service:

Commerce:
Curated access to the best-fitting Style and Active apparel (led
by Dia & Co's beloved owned brands), fully equipping her to express herself through style. Customized shopping experiences to remove the stress around fit, for a joyful and fabulous experience.

Community:
Platforms to foster deep connections between members both of offline and online, offering a place for her to be celebrated and to celebrate others through style.

Change:
Campaigns to create lasting change by combating stereotypes and biases. Advocacy to increase representation of our community outside the Dia ecosystem, so she can see herself reflected in style.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-gilbert-37a7466

Higher Achievement is rigorous. From 5th through 8th grade, Higher Achievement scholars spend 650 hours a year learning an advanced curriculum that is aligned to state standards. 

Higher Achievement's year-round program is grounded in research. It combines high expectations with high support — demanding academic work plus mentoring, skill-building, individual student achievement plans, and personal encouragement. Elements of Higher Achievement include:

- Afterschool Academy includes core subjects, such as literature and mathematics, as well as seminars, artistic electives, field trips, and opportunities to engage in community service.

- Summer Academy includes coursework in literature, science, mathematics, social studies, and electives, as well as a three-day trip to a college. Small classes and mentoring sessions encourage intellectual curiosity and teach both basic skills and critical thinking. 

- Higher Achievement culminates with high school placement services, which help scholars advance to top academic high schools. In addition to helping scholars identify schools that fit their needs, Higher Achievement helps them prepare for placement tests, practice interview skills, complete applications, and identify resources for financial assistance.

The Higher Achievement program also includes special academic events, including geography challenges, student readings of their own poetry, Olympics of the Mind, and the Green Apple awards.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/lynsey-wood-jeffries-2157484

Manuel,Chief Executive Officer,manuel.vazquez@bajaaquafarms.mx,United States,food production,86500000.0,Baja Aqua Farms,Manuel Vazquez,1999.0,San Diego,"Baja Aqua Farms was founded just before the turn of the century in 1999. Since its creation, BAF has held an unwavering belief that our oceans are an integral part of humanity; providing us with nourishment, prosperity, and an honorable means of life. Holding this deep respect for our oceans, the company has stayed true to its moral and ethical compass along its journey as a world leading producer of fresh, sashimi grade Pacific Bluefin Tuna (PBFT); constructively questioning its own business model, strategy, and farm and resources management practices along the way. Currently, BAF holds more than 12 km2 (roughly 3,000 acres) of lease sites for the production of PBFT along the northern Pacific coast of Mexico. 

BAF has played a critical role in not only developing the sustainable aquaculture industry in Mexico but in the recovery story of the PBFT which in 2010 was listed as an at-risk species due to a historically low wild stock; advocating for strict quota management measures and promoting the shift from a commodity trade to a premium product. 

Throughout its journey, BAF has been very prudent about its growth; integrating components into its core business as it expands its capabilities and innovates its business model to enrich its value chain. As a result of deliberate, and exceptionally executed plans, today, BAF is a vertically integrated company with capabilities that span from the spotting and fishing of wild PBFT in Mexican waters, the transfer of live PBFT into holding pens, the fishing of bait fish as fresh feed, the holding, rearing, and slaughter of PBFT, through to the marketing and sales of fresh, premium grade, best choice PBFT. 

BAF´s core philosophy is centered around innovation and continuous improvement as well as an untamed spirit of adventure that demands bravery, ambition, independence, and an intrepid curiosity that drives it to break out of its comfort zone into a never-ending search for new, unmapped horizons.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelhvazquez

Since we're all just very literally bodies of water, being dehydrated by 4% of your body mass can reduce your response time by nearly 25%. So whether you're at a building site or in the boardroom, staying hydrated makes you feel better and perform better too.

To help you do just that, we're proud to operate the only network of low waste vending stations serving a selection of purified water, carbonated, flavored, and branded drinks in infinite bottles that could never end up in landfill.

We've created bottled water for the future, making it ...

Safer: To lower the carbon output, we source water locally instead of shipping it, and purify it with an advanced filtration process. Our water quality beats market standards—and we like to keep things transparent by sharing that data with you.

Healthier: Along with clean water, we then create flavored and carbonated drinks free from microplastics, because our infinite bottles are made from glass or stainless steel.

You can also optimize your hydration with the Kadeya app, to make

Province Brands technology allows the company to make food grade sugars from non-starch plant material, specifically cellulose and hemicellulose. This innovation allows 1) the use of plants as initial biomass that are not food sources for the world's population and, 2) allows the use of plants that would be considered waste materials from other manufacturing processes and 3) decrease the overall carbon footprint of the food and beverage industry by reducing carbon emissions and waste disposal costs. In addition, these novel techniques can provide the flavorful and nutritious functional beverages demanded by health-conscious consumers.

To date, Province Brands has created several proof-of-concept foods and beverages. It has created a premium plant-based hemp syrup that proudly competes with Manuka honey, agave syrup and yacon syrup in composition and flavour. Brewing its hemp sugars, the company has also produced the world's first hemp beer, gluten free and lower calorie.

Past music directors have included Fritz Reiner (1938-1948), William Steinberg (1952-1976), André Previn (1976-1984), Lorin Maazel (1984-1996) and Mariss Jansons (1995-2004).  This tradition of outstanding music directors was furthered in fall 2008, when Austrian conductor Manfred Honeck became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra has been at the forefront of championing new American works, and gave the first performance of Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 ""Jeremiah"" in 1944 and John Adams' Short Ride in a Fast Machine in 1986. The Pittsburgh Symphony has a long and illustrious history in the areas of recordings and radio concerts. Its ""Pittsburgh Live!"" series with Reference Recordings has resulted in back-to-back Grammy Award nominations in 2015 and 2016. As early as 1936, the Pittsburgh Symphony radio broadcasts aired nationally and in the late 1970s it made the ground breaking PBS series ""Previn and the Pittsburgh."" Since 1982, the orchestra has been heard through national network radio broadcasts on Public Radio International, produced by Classical WQED-FM, made possible by the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.  At home in historic Heinz Hall, the Pittsburgh Symphony offers a variety of musical experiences, including its BNY Mellon Grand Classics and PNC Pops series, FUSE@PSO series, Fiddlesticks Family Concerts series, specials, and numerous community engagement and education concerts throughout the region. With a long and distinguished history of touring both domestically and overseas since 1900 — including international tours to Europe, the Far East and South America—the Pittsburgh Symphony continues to be critically acclaimed as one of the world's greatest orchestras.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/melia-tourangeau-092985121

As a full classroom system, Levered delivers value beyond the sum of its parts.

• Individually paced, adaptive online curriculum
• Multi-standard collaborative pencil & paper challenges
• Integrated whole class activities
• Data-driven intervention support for struggling students

Despite a flood of ed-tech math programs,  60% of 4th graders in California don't meet standards, growing to nearly 70% by 5th grade. Students using Levered in schools in California in 2017-2018 exceeded state growth by 170%.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-slater-143b3853

Then, each month they receive a NaturAll Club box customized to meet their hair needs - complete with everything for a spa-night at home. It's that easy! 

Organic products are the fastest growing type of products in the beauty and cosmetics industry. But even with the increasing natural options, hair care products are still limited. Due to the short shelf life, many conventional hair products avoid using fresh ingredients such as avocados, bananas and coconut crème found to help hair become healthier when used regularly.  Therefore the only way to really get fresh hair products is to do-it-yourself at home.
 
But while many are enticed, the vast majority are easily discouraged by the time needed to research, buy, & mix the right ingredients. NaturAll Club is the solution to these deterrents.

By using a subscription model we can ship products within one week after they are made, delivering the freshest ingredients in hair care. Our product development is led by a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering allowing us to provide customization to hair care needs.

The founders recognized the opportunity to combine environmental domain expertise with intelligent and patient capital to benefit from regulatory driven compensatory spend. 

ESP's strategy is to purchase land or interests in land that can generate significant restoration yields following successful entitlement and ecological restoration and/or enhancement combined with long-term conservation of the properties. The successful execution of ESP's strategy provides a long-lasting positive impact to the environment.

ESP seeks to invest in locations that have strong existing or expected mitigation demand from a diversified customer base (often a mix of industrial, commercial and public infrastructure demand) or a fully committed, concentrated source of demand (e.g. a large mining project under a long-term mitigation supply contract). As a leading provider of investment capital for large-scale mitigation projects, ESP has unique access to mitigation markets that have not traditionally used third-party mitigation solutions including those dominated by large-scale extractive (mining, oil & gas, etc.) and public infrastructure (levees, dams, pipelines, highways, etc.) development.

We also seek to partner with related service providers or land owners that have an interest in establishing wetland or stream restoration opportunities as well as potential customers that have a need for an experienced wetlands or stream restoration service provider.

Supported by $250 million of committed equity, ESP is one of the best capitalized operators in the environmental services market.

Part of the federal government's Manufacturing USA network, REMADE is dedicated to accelerating the U.S.'s transition to a Circular Economy.

Investments in renewables are critical, but they can only get us a little more than halfway - 55% - toward our nation's net-zero by 2050 goal. A Circular Economy approach to how we make and use things - how we manufacture and use everyday products - will make up the remaining 45%, getting us all the way to net-zero. 

REMADE is committed to meeting the nation's climate and industrial decarbonization goals by addressing manufacturing's impact on climate change. Today, manufacturing accounts for 25% of U.S. energy consumption at a cost of $150 billion. Industry is also the third-largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at 22%. 

Together with our partners, REMADE invests in early-stage R&D projects that reduce energy consumption, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, conserve resources, increase the supply and use of recycled materials, enhance the resiliency of the nation's supply chain, increase U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, and create clean economy jobs. 

The technologies that REMADE develops increase the reuse, remanufacturing, recovery and recycling of four ""hard-to-abate"" materials: metals, plastics/polymers, fibers/paper, and e-waste. These technologies, once fully deployed, are capable of :
- saving 1 quad of energy, the equivalent of conserving 180 million barrels of oil
- reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 MMT per year, the equivalent of eliminating the annual emissions of 11.5 million cars
- generating billions of dollars in new opportunities, supporting U.S. economic growth
- creating and retaining hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the U.S.

Your data  may be infected with ransomware without you, or your security solution, knowing till it's too late. 

These attacks often remain undetected for months, slowly infecting your data, which results in your backups being rendered useless when you need them most to recover during an attack. Without understanding your data's integrity, you risk losing everything, even if you think you're protected. 

Elastio's Ransomware Recovery Assurance platform is uniquely engineered to address this critical gap. By deeply understanding how ransomware encrypts data and leveraging its AI/ML data integrity technologies, Elastio finds the hidden ransomware that other solutions can't detect– ensuring early alerting and identification of issues and enabling safe recoveries of your critical data post-attack.

Elastio will not only alert you when it discovers a potential problem, but Elastio will identify the last known clean recovery point before the attack, eliminating what could be a lengthy and costly process after an outage.

Nardagani® is based on a Japanese reading system called Hiragana, where symbols ""live"" under letters that make more than one sound. Japan has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. The symbols act as signposts showing students how to accurately sound out words. After completing the five-week course, the symbols are removed, like training wheels from a bicycle, and students are reading on their own.

The founder of our program learned to read Japanese in one week when she lived in Japan by learning Hiragana. She has since adapted this system for English. 

The Nardagani program is revolutionary in its simplicity. Our approximately 15-hour program can help challenged readers of all ages and backgrounds and English as a Second Language (ESL) students alike. Our robust digital program can be accessed on MAC, PC, tablets, iOS and Android.

The company employs a proprietary platform to discern the gut microbiome's role in the cause and progression of disease. Therapeutics are developed to precisely target pathogenic pathways in the gut lumen. AI capabilities efficiently identify drug candidates with desired characteristics which are validated in the company's lab. 

Products consist of small molecule drugs. Piton does NOT develop live bacterial therapeutics (LBTs) or seek to modify the composition of microbiota in the gut.

Piton's lead pipelines, IBD/Ulcerative Colitis & Autism Spectrum Disorder, target unmet needs in markets with 5 million and 50+ million patients, respectively. Parkinson's Disease constitutes a third area of focus.

Piton's therapeutic approach for Ulcerative Colitis uniquely targets a cause of the disease for a sub-type constituting ~45% of the patient population. The approach has strong support in the clinical community and represents a potential ‘paradigm change' in the treatment of the disease. In-human trials are anticipated in 2025.

Recently published research suggests that Piton's therapeutic strategy for UC may have application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight loss management.

Piton's therapeutic approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder has been validated in successive, in-vivo experiments. Several drug candidates are under consideration for what could be the first approved drug to treat the core symptoms of ASD.

Application of Piton's discovery platform for Parkinson's Disease led to the discovery of a causative hypothesis and a target for novel therapeutic intervention. Given strong links between this hypothesis and many chronic diseases, including Intestinal Bowel Disease (IBD), this program may hold cross-disease blockbuster potential.

Noah,Chief Executive Officer,noah@ripplecrew.com,United States,human resources,,"Ripple Analytics, Inc",Noah Pusey,2014.0,,"Ripple is an innovative and unique application that generates, short, effective mobile surveys to be completed by a user's co-employees. These surveys (Reflection Surveys) include questions targeted to reveal the perception of all employees from the viewpoint of their fellow employees. The Reflection Surveys are short (20 seconds to complete), concise (5 question per survey), easy (respondents score an employee on a 1-5 scale) and provide respondent anonymity to ensure truly authentic and genuine feedback and actionable information.  Reflection Surveys are focused on the less tangible aspects of employee productivity and inherent links to corporate goals and culture.

The result?  Ripple tallies the data collected from completed Reflection Surveys to calculate a user's Ripple Effect Score - the cumulative impact (positive, negative or otherwise) a person has on his/her colleagues in the workplace.  Honest, genuine and actionable feedback!  Much better than the traditional ""annual review"" model used at most organizations.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-l-pusey-81236229

GAIMIN Empowers Gamers Leveraging Web3 Technology in Building the Future of Cloud Computing | Top 5 Esports Organization Gaimin Gladiators

Large Scale Decentralized Processing Power... From Our All-In-One Gamer Solution

The Gaimin.io Project Overview

The Gaimin.io project connects the world's largest decentralized processing power supply, which belongs to the 1.5 billion gaming PCs in the global gaming community, with the rapidly growing, worldwide demand for massive processing power.

What is the Gaimin Platform?

The Gaimin.io platform is a Windows-based software application for a PC gamer that allows him to monetize his resources (processing power) when not being used. It then gives him a complete environment to spend his rewards to enhance his gaming fun, including the purchase of games and gaming assets via the integrated marketplace and community.

How Does it Work?

Once downloaded and installed, the Gaimin.io platform auto-connects the gamer's PC to our ""Monetization Network"" allowing the gamer to contribute their unused processing power passively.

The Gaimin.io ""A.I. Engine"" then directs this processing power to monetization opportunities, such as computations that confirm and validate blockchain transactions or video rendering tasks that require large amounts of computational power... And because the platform only activates when the gamer's resources are not being used, it doesn't affect gaming performance in any way.

The gamer is rewarded for contributing their processing capacity with Gaimin.io's native GMRX tokens, which can then be used as purchasing power within the Gaimin.gg marketplace and community in order to purchase games, NFTs, gaming assets, and for ""user-to-user"" transactions (buy, sell, rent).

Where Can I See More Information?

Sequoia invented the LISST series of aquatic science sensors in 1995. Since then, more than 40 different types of sensors have been developed, prototyped, or manufactured by Sequoia. Today, thousands of Sequoia instruments are in use, helping ocean and freshwater scientists and managers around the world better understand our oceans and the aquatic environment. All design and production takes place in our Bellevue, WA location. Our sales staff is located in Bellevue, WA and Mobile, AL.

LISST was originally an acronym for our laser particle sizing sensors (Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissometry). LISST now is ‘just' a Sequoia trade name. Most of our instruments still use lasers in one way or the other to make measurements. A few use LED's or acoustics. Sometimes two methodologies are used together.

Several of our instruments measure the in-situ size and/or concentration of suspended particles – sediment grains, algae, flocs, oil droplets, air bubbles, aeolian sediment, drilling fluids etc. One model takes pretty particle pictures using holography. Others again measure water optical properties such as beam attenuation, Volume Scattering Function (VSF), and hyperspectral backscatter. The instruments are primarily used for ocean science and freshwater research and for environmental monitoring. However, some are used in select industries in a range of drilling fluid, hydropower, and general process control applications.

How do you know if you need a LISST? Are you an oceanographer, limnologist, biogeochemist, geographer, geologist, soil scientist or coastal, environmental, consulting or drilling engineer? Or do you have an interest in (suspended) particle measurements or the optical properties of water? Or do you work in Industrial Process?

To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics. 

For licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities. 

For AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo's patented system offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost.

Companies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.  

For patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations. 

With DataNovo, companies are able to obtain stronger, more defensible patents, challenge frivolous lawsuits, assess critical licensing or infringing intelligence, and make informed business and strategic decisions throughout the companies'​ life cycles.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandr-loginov-b8910818a

People as early as age 35 are dropping out of the workforce due to presbyopia and being driven deeper into poverty for this reason: a lack of access to reading glasses.

WHY RESTORINGVISION?
RestoringVision is a leading global nonproﬁt dedicated to creating equitable access to vision services and eyeglasses for people living on less than $2 a day worldwide. 

Since 2003, RestoringVision's interventions have transformed the lives of 28M people in need worldwide. In 2024 alone, RestoringVision's programs will reach 5.5 million people living in poverty. 

RestoringVision's proven programs are implemented in partnership with over 3,000 NGO and government partners, as the organization also serves as a leading voice and advocate for the global prioritization of eye health at the level of the United Nations and World Health Organization.

Industrial companies deploy a range of sensors, controllers and technology at the ""edge"" to achieve their
business goals, but often they have no way to unify legacy and modern systems or integrate different legacy protocols to implement systems at scale. Building custom systems for IoT is the dominant marketplace solution, but it is cost prohibitive and time consuming. Further technology obsolescence is a big barrier to large scale implementation of long-lived systems.

Our products, the Machfu platform and the Machfu gateway, bring edge to enterprise connectivity to existing industrial infrastructure that can be deployed and scaled quickly. Rapid and highly secure application development means increased productivity and efficiency as well as improved operations. Using our Machfu gateways, our customers can easily build applications that integrate their existing technology and equipment with the cloud.

Businesses want to take advantage of the flexibility, scalability, and speed of the cloud. However, lack of proactive and automated processes for cloud management can lead to challenges such as increased costs, higher residual risk, and the impediment of DevOps. By delivering consistent security and compliance across cloud environments, Cloud Raxak enables businesses to undergo successful cloud transformations while reducing the risk, time, and costs involved.

Some key issues of cloud security are:
-- Security compliance is up to 40% of the cost of managing cloud applications
-- Manual or semi-automated security management is slow, error prone, and insecure
-- 50% of public cloud VM security parameters are configured incorrectly at boot
-- 95% of public cloud VM security parameters can be configured automatically, significantly reducing the time, costs, and human error involved

Raxak Protect is a SaaS-based security offering that empowers IT and application development teams, by simplifying and automating security and compliance across private and public clouds. Key features of the platform include:
-- Leading edge security profiles based on government and industry standards (CIS, DISA & NIST STIGs, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FFIEC, FISMA, etc.)
-- Automatic integration and application of security profiles, so that cloud apps can be deployed quickly, cost-effectively, and without human error
-- Application of security profiles across clouds, enabling consistent and continuous protection
-- One-touch security compliance through IT service catalog tools like HP Cloud Service Automation, enabling both skilled and novice users to protect enterprise data
-- Integration into DevOps, enabling flexible security throughout application lifecycles

The analogy we use is that data vendors are selling car parts. Imagine walking into a Honda dealership, and instead of selling you a Civic, they sold you an engine, and you had to build your own car.

It turns out that SMBs  don't care about buying and integrating multiple vendors. They want a complete platform (car) that works out of the box. That's exactly what we have created at 5X.

Companies use 5X for 3 reasons:

 1) Build a data platform from scratch, or fill in missing pieces on your existing platform.

2) Decrease the total cost of ownership by up to 50%.

3) Use our full stack data consultancy for support on data strategy, analytics, data engineering, cost optimization or AI/ML.

5X was founded in 2020 with presence in the USA, Singapore, UK and India. Our global team is 70+ people strong and rapidly growing.

ISNO inventory occurs when products are available in-store and often in the warehouse but not online, resulting in lost sales from customers who cannot find the product they want on a retailer's website. 

Retailers are struggling to accurately manage their ISNO inventory and keep it up-to-date with changes in their physical stores.ISNO arises from an over-reliance on manual processes and spreadsheets to manage the creation of the required digital assets and data. The disconnected processes and systems retailers use fail to provide the visibility and operational efficiency required to quickly launch products. Enter Sweft, the ultimate solution to ISNO. Sweft is a SaaS workflow productivity tool designed to help retailers launch products more efficiently, resulting in optimized full-price sales. Sweft was created by an experienced team of former e-commerce retailers with a deep understanding of the ISNO problem. With Sweft, retailers sell more products at full price, improving profitability.

An end-to-end solution, Sweft increases revenues and profitability by enhancing collaboration & communication across the company, and by improving productivity through reduction of data entry and tedious tasks.

Today we have a growing user base, who are happy to have found a method of birth control that is right for them and that allows them to get to know their bodies and cycles. No matter what your choice is, we believe that every woman should know that understanding how your cycle works matters. 

Natural Cycles was created when our founders, Elina and Raoul, were in search of an effective method of natural birth control. Their journey took them from physics straight into health tech for women. The couple were unsatisfied with what they found, so they decided to apply their experience and knowledge in advanced mathematics and data analysis to develop a solution to meet their needs. This turned out to be an algorithm that detects and predicts ovulation and fertility.

In the early days, they used the algorithm for their own purposes but quickly realized that there was a vast unmet need for this type of method. They decided to develop a mobile app so women from all over the world could easily access and use Natural Cycles.

Our company has been up and running since 2013 and has been rapidly growing since our CE certification in February 2017. At Natural Cycles we are always looking for passionate talents to help us strive for change in such a complex, scientific, and controversial field.

As the creative force behind beautyblender, she single-handedly changed the beauty game. 
 
The beautyblender concept came to Rea Ann while she was the Department Head of one of the first TV shows shot in hi-definition. Rea Ann handled the constant touch-ups with her hand-cut, edgeless sponges to mimic the seamless look of airbrushing. Soon, every celebrity that sat in Rea Ann's chair wanted their own hand-cut sponge; thus creating the original edgeless sponge. Beautyblender quickly became the secret on set that had every pro talking.
 
Today, the category-creator holds countless beauty awards and is beloved by both makeup aficionados and newbies as the go-to tool for achieving a perfectly blended complexion. As Beautyblender expands, we continue to innovate easy-to-use products that require minimal efforts yet offer maximum results.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/rea-ann-silva-45a5ba338

Our mission is to get freshly harvested, heirloom spices that were grown for their flavor and aroma into your hands as quickly and ethically as possible. As of 2021, we work with roughly 150 farm partners and over 1000 farm partners across 10 states in India & Sri Lanka. 



Growing a better spice trade - from small Indian farms to your kitchen.


We put flavor first - for hundreds of years the spice trade has prioritized high volume and profits at the expense of taste. We work with heirloom seed varieties, and in constant collaboration with our partner farms to curate only the most delicious spices grown for flavor first. 

Equality is at the heart of our work - we pay our partner farms an average of 6x the market price for their produce. We recognize that the commodity food system is broken, and that as leaders in sustainability and regenerative ag, our partner farmers deserve a rich premium, as well as harvest advances, and full healthcare for all their laborers. 

We take our time - we spend anywhere from 6 months - 2 years sourcing a new spice - making several farm visits and always in search of true excellence. If we don't find a good enough spice, we don't launch it. Simple. 

Culture matters - South Asian flavors, stories and foodways are heroically underrepresented in the grocery and kitchen landscape. We're giving context, nuance and color to the cuisines of our homelands and diaspora. We believe that a business rooted in cultural work and true community is one that'll last.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sana-javeri-kadri-b8307058

With prices falling by 80% in less than a decade, solar power is now within reach of every American household.

Here's the problem: 90 million American households are currently locked out of the solar marketplace. Maybe it's because they rent their homes. Or other solar companies are not willing to sell to them. Or simply because their roof is in the shade or is not well-suited to a solar array.

Our mission is to unlock the possibility of solar power for these households.  

With the help of transformative policies taking root in the United States, we are now in a position to do so.  It's called ""community solar.""​  What it means is that a household can buy solar power without having an array installed on its roof.  

Here's what we noticed: in communities all across the country, there are extraordinary organizations -- from the church down the street to the college campus across town -- that are embracing clean energy and want to bring it to their constituents.  There are also households that want to go solar but do not have an easy way to do so.  Finally, there are solar companies eager to find more customers.

Our goal as Solstice is to use community solar to help these groups meet one another. 

When we do, everybody wins: those who cannot currently access solar are brought into the market, more solar is deployed, and everyone saves on their electricity bills.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandhyamurali

Sasha,Chief Executive Officer,sasha@femselect.com,United States,medical devices,10200000.0,FEMSelect,Sasha Schrode,2012.0,Philadelphia,"Israel-based FEMSelect® is the developer of EnPlace®, the FDA cleared and CE Marked system for suturing ligaments of the pelvic floor as an approach to minimally-invasive Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) procedures. The EnPlace® approach is much simpler to perform – and much easier to recover from - than the current standard of care dissection approach.

 The Problem: Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) is a painful, debilitating medical condition that occurs when the normal support of the vagina is lost, resulting in the ""sagging"" or dropping of the female pelvic organs. POP is a very common and bothersome condition facing many women.

 The Unmet Need: A Simple and Safe Pelvic Floor Repair System. The current standard of care includes hysterectomy or complicated mesh surgery. Mesh has been associated with pain, bleeding and other complications. In 2011, the FDA issued warnings regarding transvaginal mesh and many products were withdrawn from the market, leaving few good options. Many women believe they must live with the pain and discomfort due to the lack of simple, safe solutions.

The Market: It is estimated that the lifetime prevalence for a woman is between 30-50%. The global market for the devices is $10 billion and is growing due to the aging population.

Unique approach: FEMSelect's EnPlace® is both FDA-cleared and CE Marked.  EnPlace® is a truly minimally-invasive surgical system that is simpler than the current standard of care. The surgery is conducted with no deep dissection and no mesh. The device is a combination of a Nitinol-based anchor, surgical sutures and an innovative method of attachment.  EnPlace® was tested in a large Post-Marketing Study in the US, Germany and Israel and is now available commercially in the US and Israel.  The EnPlace® technology is protected by global and US patents.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sasha-schrode-28589a13

Mendoza Ventures is an early-stage and growth venture fund based in Boston. The firm is run by husband and wife Adrian and Senofer Mendoza, entrepreneurs and prior operators who are veterans of the local startup ecosystem. The firm focuses on investments in fintech, AI, and cybersecurity, with diversity playing an important role in their investment decisions—about 70% of their portfolio consists of startups led by immigrants, people of color, and women. Mendoza started off as a pilot fund in 2016; after an exit and the realization that they had good traction with early-stage startups in Boston, Adrian and Senofer decided to focus exclusively on the seed-stage and formally launched Mendoza Ventures Fund II in 2019. Since then, the firm has made twelve investments and recruited senior managers, C-level executives, and domain experts as operating partners from places like State Street, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft.

Firm strategy
Mendoza Ventures takes a depth-focused approach, looking for founders who demonstrate domain expertise in one of their three main focus areas across fintech, AI, and cybersecurity. Adrian and Senofer pride themselves on being hands-on investors and setting up companies for success beyond just writing a check—they will help create a strong early funding syndicate, make customer introductions, and assist with partnership conversations. They really tap into their experience as former entrepreneurs to get in the trenches with their founders, with Adrian optimizing business structures and Senofer leveraging her sales and marketing expertise.

When you wash your car with a Rubbit kit, you only use 40 ounces of water per wash. In comparison, a regular home wash typically uses about 20-40 gallons of water, while a basic car wash tunnel can consume 60-120 gallons per wash. By using Rubbit, you can save over 3,000 gallons of clean drinking water annually as one car owner. Our formula is made from eco-friendly materials, With its neutral pH level, it guarantees effective and safe use, not only for your car, but also for the skin, respiration, and the environment.

Determined to change the car care conservative industry and to find a solution to the massive waste of water and chemicals, we conducted extensive research with chemists and a detergent factory, leading to the development of a revolutionary cleaning formula that turns into foam, absorbs dirt, and only needs to be wiped, without rinsing.

With over 10,000 satisfied customers on our pilot program, we are rapidly expanding.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/shaked-leist-994011175

West Side Forward> is Bethel's strategic initiative to transform Chicago's West Side by substantially reducing poverty utilizing tactics that will move 63,000 people into skilled work that can sustain their families.

To achieve our mission, West Side Forward> focuses on four key tactics:
-- Creating 36,000 new West Side Jobs and 90,000 jobs across Chicago in a decade
-- Preparing 116,000 West Side residents for jobs in high demand, growth industries that pay a family living wage
-- Connecting 63,000 residents to jobs that pay at least $36,000 per year
-- Supporting residents once in jobs to ensure a steady state increase of 63,000 in our communities

The price of poverty is high. To face the coming economic challenges, the U.S. needs to build a workforce that can compete in the 21st century and enable all of its citizens to contribute their talents and skills. Yet, this is something that we are struggling to do, in large part because tens of millions of Americans live in poverty. And in terms of poverty, Chicago's West Side communities are among the most disadvantaged in the City.
-- Bethel support 5 neighborhoods on Chicago's West Side: Austin, East and West Garfield Park, Humboldt Park and North Lawndale
-- 210,000 people live in these communities, encompassing 16 sq miles
-- Poverty and unemployment rates are more than twice those seen in the City overall
-- Per capita income is less than half of that of Chicago
-- More than 60% of residents have a HS education or less

Transforming the West Side of Chicago will take substantial, focused investment in getting West Side residents employed in skilled jobs. We need your help to achieve the goals of West Side Forward>.

It is currently estimated that only 5% of companies offer this benefit, although 42% of the workforce has at least one child dependent on them for care.  Backup Care allows employees to hire highly vetted caregivers to come to their homes and care for family members when they experience a breakdown in their regular care structure.   This service bridges the care gap caused by school closures, illnesses, travel for work, and can even include Pet Care and Tutoring Support Services.  Backup Care is provided to children, parents, or any other adult dependent of an employee.

CorporateCARE Solutions is unique in the payment structure we offer for employers.  We believe all employers should be able to afford this benefit for employees, so we have a Pay-As-You-Go model and never have a utilization minimum.  This valuable benefit ensures employees no longer miss work unexpectedly due to breakdowns in family care. Knowing they can leave their loved ones at home with a professional caregiver enables them to be on the job with true peace of mind.

UNMET NEED
Although there have been considerable advancements in developing therapies to lower ""bad"" cholesterol in the past 25 years, a significant number of patients are either unresponsive or experience concerning side effects with current treatment options, including statins.  To address these concerns, more aggressive and selective targeted therapies are needed. One promising avenue for developing specific LDL-C lowering agents is the LDL receptor (LDLR) degradation pathway, which is primarily mediated by the critical regulatory protein known as PCSK9. PCSK9 controls the degradation of the LDLR in the liver and thereby contributes to cholesterol homeostasis. 

TARGET PCSK9
Several strategies have been tried for targeting PCSK9. Most have focused on the development of injectable biologics.  The most successful approach is the injection of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that interfere with the function of PCSK9.  To date, however, no orally bioavailable anti-PCSK9 drug has advanced to the clinic. We have pursued proprietary approaches and identified an orally bioavailable, first-in-class small molecule lead compound, P-21 that interferes with the function of PCSK9.

LOWER CHOLESTEROL
Shifa's oral small molecule lead compound significantly lowers LDL-C; it is as potent as the injectable monoclonal antibody.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/sherin-abdel-meguid-36618a2

Matrix removes the potential for Source of Income discrimination, taking the subsidy into consideration and automating the underwriting process. On the back end, today's processing time for Affordable Housing is approximately 36 days.

Our pipeline of drug candidates is based on a new platform technology that modulates macrophages in the innate immune system to restore balance while fighting both infection and inflammation. Stimulating these macrophages produces a rapid therapeutic response throughout the body as we have seen in our strong preclinical data. This is unlike any existing immunotherapies today - immunotherapies which in total have annual sales of $70B. Because the antimicrobial action of our compounds is through the activation of phagocytosis, the development of multidrug resistance is not anticipated.

Our goal is to save and improve lives, reduce hospital costs, & provide an effective treatment to diseases like BPD, VAP, and ARDS with no adverse side effects that are seen with the current alternatives. 

Our lead candidate is Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designated by the US FDA for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in at-risk preterm infants. BPD is a rare pediatric lung disease in preterm babies caused by inflammation from supplemental oxygen required for survival in the NICU and is the second leading cause of death in preterm babies. An average of 112 preterm babies die per month in the US due to the lack of an effective therapy and survivors require ongoing care.

We believe standalone AI technologies cannot emulate true human intelligence that consists of deep knowledge and proactive interactions, nor create platforms that can interact with humans over long periods of time to help us reach conscious objectives. A new approach to building truly intelligent systems needs to be grounded in both biology and technology. It needs to be compounded by commercialization, and it needs to be tied to a spiritual vision that goes beyond a single self. 

Atman's unique research lies at the novel intersection of custom Reinforcement Learning environments, large-scale Knowledge Representation, and multi-modal Generative Models, which mimic how humans dynamically strategize and interact with the world, reason, and communicate. We are deploying our platform in products across a number of commercial domains to demonstrate the value of our approach – starting with building proactive shopping concierges for e-commerce, to eventually launching products that scale expert-led interactions across travel, healthcare, education, and more. By building machines that emulate human experts and act symbiotically with humans, we want to allow humans to experience a higher level of consciousness in their lives and develop a deeper intuition of consciousness as a whole.

H2Pro's E-TAC electrolyzer is a revolutionary system for producing green hydrogen by splitting water at 95% energy efficiency (compared to 60-70% efficiency of conventional systems).  This breakthrough efficiency combined with E-TAC's reduced cost of materials, easily scalable membraneless design, and high compatibility with renewables will allow H2Pro systems to deliver the lowest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH).

In order to reach net zero, green hydrogen must be integrated into hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel, ammonia, refineries, heavy transport and aviation. It will also serve a critical role in energy storage and as a green molecule for renewable energy export. H2Pro is committed to accelerating the widespread adoption of this vital decarbonization tool by making it economically viable by the end of this decade. 

Headquartered in Caesarea, Israel, H2Pro was founded in 2019 based on years of research conducted at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. H2Pro has raised over 100 Million USD. It is backed by leading investors and strategic partners, including Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Temasek Holdings, Horizons Ventures, ArcelorMittal, Yara Growth Ventures, OurCrowd, COPEC, Hyundai, Sumitomo Corporation, Extantia, Bazan, Doral and New Fortress Energy.

Strand's mRNA programming  technology promises to make  mRNA therapies safer and more  effective by programming the  location, timing, and intensity of  therapeutic protein expression inside a patient's body via mRNA-encoded logic circuits.

Teague,Founder & CEO,teague@energyx.com,United States,renewables & environment,400000000.0,EnergyX,Teague Egan,2018.0,,"EnergyX is a sustainable energy company focused on direct lithium extraction, refinery and battery technology.  Combining these technologies from brine to battery will create a process dramatically lowering the cost of lithium resources.  The company's goal is to develop technology and assets that turn it into one of the premier, low-cost lithium providers for the growing lithium-ion battery industry.

The electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage revolution is generating high demand for lithium, with some analysts forecasting orders-of-magnitude demand increases.  As the EV market rapidly expands, millions of large-scale battery packs will be in demand.  The estimated annual production of EV's is 20,000,000 per year.   For one 85-kWh car, the price of the lithium in the battery is approximately $2,945 per car.  Residential (home) and commercial batteries are also gaining market demand traction, and California has implemented law stating by 2020 all new homes will require solar arrays.  

Companies already producing lithium are attempting to increase production as battery cell manufacturers are scaling up lithium-ion production with mega factories and actively acquiring raw materials through long term off-take supply agreements.  In the Lithium Triangle, where 50-70% of the world's known lithium reserve is located, current methods of extraction are based off outdated, natural evaporation pond technology, which takes 18 months, and loses 50-70% of the lithium due to co-precipitation. 

Our solution is to optimize and apply a highly scalable lithium extraction membrane to the process.  The ability to efficiently extract and aggregate the lithium elements from the salt brines using proprietary, multi-level, synthetic ion separation techniques can increase time efficiency by 100x and recovery rate by 300%.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/teagueegan

In 2011, the organization went through a major overhaul that allowed it to re-invent itself and create a new strategic plan. Through this process, the Mission EDC board agreed to focus on five areas:


·       Entrepreneurship and STEAM Education

·       Infrastructure and Transportation

·       Quality of Life

·       Business Expansion and Retention

·       Recruitment


It was a board consensus that education is the foundation to economic development and without it makes the other areas of focus difficult to achieve. Thus, the board agreed to focus on Entrepreneurship and STEAM Education as its main priority. Consequently, three initiatives were created to address this number one priority: Ruby Red Ventures, Code the Town, and Enginuity.

Our Mission:
Cincinnati Works will partner with all willing and capable people living in poverty to assist them in advancing to economic self-sufficiency through employment.

Our Vision:
We will lead the effort to eliminate poverty in our community.


Cincinnati Works serves two clients: those individuals in the community who are currently unemployed or underemployed and Employers who have entry level positions. The short-term goal for the unemployed is to help them stabilize in a job that pays a living wage with health benefits.

The long-term goal for the underemployed is for them to earn 200% of the federal poverty rate and move to economic self-sufficiency. Economically self-sufficient people become taxpayers and productive citizens who no longer require public assistance.

As a primarily privately-funded organization, we are able to serve any willing and capable job seekers who are eligible for our program. We are able to serve those who would otherwise be ineligible for other programs (e.g. men, women without dependent children and women without children).

Our clients become Members of the Cincinnati Works program and receive lifetime Membership for as long as they are employed or actively seeking work.

There is no cost to become an Employer or Member and our services are free for both Employers & Members.

Returns are a multi-billion-dollar problem for Ready-To-Wear (""RTW"") apparel companies. Customers report that the #1 reason for returns is wrong size or fit.

Returns have high reverse logistics costs that often lead to a destruction decision as the lowest cost option. This is a growing ESG problem for companies and B-Corps.

Bodidata was created to solve the complex problem of matching different body shapes and sizes to RTW clothing, and because we understand the ""Complexity of Fit"" and the issues associated with matching infinite body shapes into RTW clothing, we know that accurate measurement is only one of the requirements for successful size-matching.

A successful size-matching provider needs to measure accurately, match skillfully, and manage customer expectations. Bodidata has addressed all of these issues with an integrated suite of solutions. We Measure.Match.Manage.™ all three essential requirements to reduce returns.

Bodidata offers every available measurement technology, to safely serve different business needs and customer preference. Competitors only offer one. The patented Kora™ scanner is the only handheld solution that measures a fully clothed individual in streetwear.

Debt was nothing new to them, as growing up in single parent homes, it was engraved in them that ""you would always owe someone"".  Determined to break the generational curses which preceded them, the couple decided to come up with a game plan to get out of debt.  Because trying to save money with $100K in debt was a lose-lose situation.

The initial step was hiring a financial advisor and coming face-to-face with the number of loans and the amounts owed.  If there was any feeling of embarrassment or being ashamed, being transparent together as a couple made the exercise far more invaluable and deepened their personal relationship beyond numbers on a piece of paper.  

By leveraging Dave Ramsey's principles, the debts were prioritized from smallest to largest including interest rates and the couple set a goal of when they wanted to become debt free.  In addition, they set a realistic budget and their journey to becoming debt free began.  Seven years later and the couple became debt free!  

In sharing their testimony with family and friends, they realized that others were suffering from the same debt burdens.  God gave the vision to SpenDebt's Founder to create a tool to help people pay off debt in parallel with their spending habits.  The Co-Founder completed a simulation to test the idea and SpenDebt was born.

Without becoming debt free, the now married couple would not have had the opportunity to see beyond the debt and provide a tool to allow people to become debt free.  The couple is on a mission to turn generational curses into generational wealth.  Becoming debt free not only increases your bank account but it opens doors and provides the ability for you to make a greater impact on the world.

Virtual currency was deemed a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. A commodity transaction must actually deliver within a 28-day period to qualify for an exception from CFTC oversight.

Our Solution
CoinRegTech operates independently from execution platforms and market participants.

Vishesh,Founder & CEO,vishesh@cloudfiles.io,India,information technology & services,,CloudFiles,Vishesh Singhal,2021.0,Bengaluru,"A Sales team typically uses 5-6 document tools:

1. Document generation tool for creating personalized proposal/contracts etc. using a template & customer data. Ex: Conga composer, Panda Docs, Quip. 
2. Document Storage tool for storing files in a cloud storage. Ex: SharePoint, Google Drive, Salesforce. 
3. Document Discovery tool for finding the right content in the business context. Ex: Seismic, Highspot. 
4. Document Sharing tool for sharing documents with customers & tracking engagement. Ex: Showpad, DocSend. 
5. E-signatures tool to Esign on documents. Ex: DocuSign, HelloSign
    
Problems with current document stack is that: 

1. These tools don't talk to each other. 
2. They add a lot of friction to the sales process. 
3. Sales people have to keep jumping between these tools. 
4. Sensitive files & customer data is scattered across these platforms. 
5. They don't integrate well with the existing processes. 

Enter CloudFiles which is a full stack document automation & sharing platform. It is:

a) Friction Eliminator: 
1. Exposed through the CRMs - acts as CRM extension & not as a new tool
2. Mirrors existing storage - Works on top of SharePoint, Google Drive etc. Customer's sensitive files remain with them.

b) Deeply Integrated:
1. CRMs are very powerful at automations, it's their core business. 
2. CloudFiles deeply integrates with these tools, harnessing the full power of CRMs. 

c) Full Stack:
1. CloudFiles would support all functions across document lifecycle, with an option to plug user's own tool as well. 
2. Ex: Someone wants to use DocuSign instead of our e-signatures, they can, in a seamless way. 

d) Highly Customizable:
1. All sales processes are unique. Salesforce understood that and pioneered CRMs.

Vito,Academic Co-Founder,v.quaranta@northeastern.edu,United States,research,,Incendia Therapeutics,Vito Quaranta,2019.0,Boston,"Incendia Therapeutics is discovering and developing novel anti-cancer medicines that are designed to reprogram the tumor microenvironment. Many cancers create immune exclusion barriers that prevent the immune system from attacking tumors. Our approach to overcoming these barriers is to modulate the interplay among cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells.  
  
Our lead program, PRTH-101, is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) with collagen, thereby ""punching holes"" in the extracellular matrix barrier created by the tumor. With the extracellular matrix barrier breached, immune cells are able to infiltrate and attack the tumor.  PRTH-101 is poised to enter Phase 1 clinical trials.  
 
PRTH-101 is followed by a pipeline of preclinical projects targeting orthogonal components of the tumor microenvironment that promote immune exclusion.  

Incendia combines its drug discovery and development efforts with a precision oncology approach to get the right medicines to the right patients. We use proprietary AI technology to digitally deconstruct the TME and develop unique insights to enable biomarker-driven patient selection strategies designed to guide clinical applications.",,,,,,,,,,http://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-quaranta-360ba935

Hydrilyte is is the most cost competitive storage solution for renewable firming.

TNEDICCA Road Risk Scores℠ quantify accident risk at the geolocation level for more granular risk assessment. Our mission is to reduce future road accidents using location-based data and predictive analytics. Our data-driven solutions support auto insurers, carmakers, navigation service providers and last-mile delivery companies.

Crash location data offers auto insurers a new way to measure road risk and reduce loss costs. Crash location data can also be used to prevent future road accidents by optimizing routes for safety.

WHY IS CRASH LOCATION IMPORTANT?
Accident hotspots are a powerful predictor of where future accidents will happen.
When it comes to measuring road risk, where a person drives matters a lot. Most road accidents are clustered in a few hotspots where driving is riskier, making crash location a powerful predictor of where future accidents will happen. A higher frequency of accidents in certain locations can often be linked to road design.

AUTO INSURER SOLUTIONS
By harnessing the power of crash location analytics, TNEDICCA offers auto insurers solutions to improve their bottom line with:
•	more precise pricing and territory ratemaking
•	better underwriting and risk selection
•	enhanced risk scoring for insurance telematics and connected car data
•	accident hotspot warnings for policyholder safe-driving apps.

Insurers of all sizes can benefit from a more complete understanding of risk that considers where a vehicle is driven.

ROAD SAFETY SOLUTIONS
TNEDICCA road safety solutions are designed to help businesses improve safety and reduce the financial impact of crashes with our proprietary nationwide database of more than 30 million crashes.

Our road safety solutions include route optimization and accident hotspot warnings for:
•	navigation service providers
•	last-mile delivery companies
